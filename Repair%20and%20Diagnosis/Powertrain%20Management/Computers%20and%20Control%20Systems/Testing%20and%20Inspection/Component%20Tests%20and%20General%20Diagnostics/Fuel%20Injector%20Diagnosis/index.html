The ignition voltage is supplied directly to the fuel injectors. The control module controls each fuel injector by grounding the control circuit via a solid state device called a driver. A fuel injector coil winding resistance that is too high or too low will affect the engine driveability. A fuel injector control circuit DTC may not set, but a misfire may be apparent. The fuel injector coil windings are affected by temperature. The resistance of the fuel injector coil windings will increase as the temperature of the fuel injector increases.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When performing the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Fuel%2520Injector/index.html">fuel injector</a> balance test, the scan tool is first used to energize the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Fuel%2520Pump%2520Relay/index.html">fuel pump relay</a>.
