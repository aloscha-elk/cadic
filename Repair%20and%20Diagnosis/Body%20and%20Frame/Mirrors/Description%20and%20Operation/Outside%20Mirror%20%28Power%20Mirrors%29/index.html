The vertical motor operates the up and down directions and the horizontal motor operates the left and right directions. If equipped with power folding mirrors, each outside power mirror will contain a reversible fold motor to operate the extend and retract functions. Each of the mirror motors are circuit breaker protected.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Power Mirror System Controls</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The <a>power mirror switch</a> incorporates a 3-position mirror select switch and a 4-position mirror direction switch. The mirror select switch allows the operator to select the mirror to be moved by selecting the L position for the left power mirror, selecting the R position for the right power mirror or the center which is the neutral/fold position. The mirror direction switch is a 4-position switch that allows the operator to move the selected mirror up, down, left or right. The mirror direction switch also functions as the folding mirror switch. When the selector switch is in the neutral/fold position, activate the mirror direction switch to the left to extend the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Mirrors/">mirrors</a> and right to retract the mirrors.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Power Mirror System Operation</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The <a>power mirror switch</a> is integrated into the DDS. The left and right mirror positions of the select switch and 4 positions of the direction switch, when active, will provide a signal to the DDS. If the selector switch is placed in the L position and the up switch is depressed, 2 signals will be supplied to the DDS. The DDS upon receipt of these signals will provide battery voltage to the mirror motor left/up control circuit and ground to the mirror motor down control circuit and the mirror will move up. The remainder of the driver mirror functions operate in the same manner as described above except the DDS will supply battery voltage and ground to the appropriate control circuits for the direction selected. If the passenger mirror is selected and a direction switch is activated, the DDS sends a LAN message to the PDS indicating that the passenger mirror was selected and the direction to be commanded. The PDS will then supply battery voltage and ground to the appropriate control circuits for the direction selected.<br><br><b>MEMORY MIRROR SYSTEM</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Memory Mirror System Controls</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The driver door switch (DDS) and passenger door switch (PDS) are capable of storing mirror positions and controlling the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Mirrors/">mirrors</a> to these positions to the preferred settings of 2 different drivers. Each driver will be able to personalize the memory system by positioning the mirrors and seats to their preferred settings. Then press and hold the memory 1 or memory 2 button until an audible chime is heard and the current mirror positions will be stored into memory of the DDS and PDS. Seat position will be stored in the driver position module (DPM). Once the mirror and seat positions have been stored into memory, a momentary memory 1 or memory 2 switch activation will supply the DDS a battery voltage signal. The DDS, upon receipt of the memory switch signal, with the transmission in park or neutral, will then drive the driver mirror to the corresponding stored memory position. The DDS will also send a LAN message to the PDS and DSM indicating that a memory switch activation occurred. The PDS will then drive the passenger mirror and the DPM will drive the driver seat to the corresponding stored memory position. The memory system can also be controlled by any of the following if programmed using the driver information center (DIC) to enable/disable the features:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Auto exit/entry seat positioning<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Mirror and seat position recall on a <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/">keyless entry</a> unlock activation<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Mirror and seat position recall on ignition <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Starting%2520and%2520Charging/Starting%2520System/Key/index.html">key</a> insertion<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>For further information on programming and configuration, refer to Driver Personalization in Personalization.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Memory Mirror System Operation</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Mirror position is determined by both horizontal and vertical position sensors in each of the power mirrors. The DDS and PDS supplies a reference voltage and a low reference to these sensors and determines mirror position through the horizontal and vertical position signal circuits.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The memory switch receives power from the DDS through the battery supply voltage circuit and the DDS fuse. The DDS upon receipt of a memory switch signal input or an appropriate LAN message from the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Body%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">BCM</a>, the DDS and PDS will then supply battery voltage and ground to the appropriate <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Mirrors/Power%2520Mirror%2520Motor/index.html">power mirror motors</a> through the mirror motor control circuits to move the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Mirrors/">mirrors</a> to the predetermined positions.<br><br><b>FOLDING MIRROR SYSTEM</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Folding Mirror System Controls</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The folding mirror system requires signals from 2 separate switches. The mirror select switch must be in the neutral/fold position and the mirror direction switch must be activated to the left/extend or right/retract positions. Both switches are integrated into the DDS and provide direct signals.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Folding Mirror System Operation</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Upon receipt of the required switch inputs the DDS will supply battery voltage and ground to the mirror fold motor control circuits to perform the requested extend or retract function. The DDS will also send a LAN message to the PDS indicating the requested function. The PDS will supply battery voltage and ground to the mirror fold motor control circuits to perform the requested extend or retract function.</div>
