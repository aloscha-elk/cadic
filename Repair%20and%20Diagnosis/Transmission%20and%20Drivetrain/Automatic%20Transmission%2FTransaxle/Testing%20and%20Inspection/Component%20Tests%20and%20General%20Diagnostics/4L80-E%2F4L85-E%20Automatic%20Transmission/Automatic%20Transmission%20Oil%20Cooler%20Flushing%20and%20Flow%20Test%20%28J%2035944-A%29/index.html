<h1>Automatic Transmission Oil Cooler Flushing and Flow Test (J 35944-A)</h1><br><br><b>Automatic Transmission Oil Cooler Flushing and Flow Test (J 35944-A)</b><br><br>GM studies indicate that plugged or restricted transmission oil coolers and pipes cause insufficient transmission lubrication and elevated operating temperatures which can lead to premature transmission wear-out. Many repeat repair cases could have been prevented by following published procedures for transmission oil cooler flushing and flow checking. This procedure includes flow checking and flushing the auxiliary transmission oil cooler, if equipped.<br><br><b>Important:</b> <b>For FWD, use the J 35944-A transmission oil cooler and line flusher or equivalent to flush the transmission oil cooler and the oil cooler pipes whenever the transaxle is removed for the following repairs:</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Torque converter</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Oil pump</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Oil pump drive shaft</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Drive sprocket support</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Transaxle overhaul complete</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Transaxle assembly replacement</b><br><br><b>Important:</b> <b>For RWD, use the J 35944-A or equivalent to flush the transmission oil cooler and the oil cooler pipes whenever the transmission is removed for the following repairs:</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Torque converter</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Oil pump</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Turbine shaft</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Transmission overhaul complete</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Transmission assembly replacement</b><br><br>Only GM Goodwrench DEXRON(R)VI automatic transmission fluid (ATF) should be used when doing a repair on a GM transmission.<br><br>Time allowance for performing the cooler flow checking and flushing procedure has been included in the appropriate labor time guide operations since the 1987 model year.
