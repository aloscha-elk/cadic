<h1>Wheels/Tires - Accessory Wheel And Tire Information</h1><b>INFORMATION</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.: </b>08-03-10-004A<br><br><b>Date: </b>July 24, 2009<br><br><b>Subject: </b>Mounting, Balancing and Installation of Accessory <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/">Wheels and Tires</a> Available Through GM Accessories<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2010 and Prior GM Passenger Cars and Light Duty Trucks (Including Saturn, EXCLUDING Astra)<br>2003-2010 HUMMER H2<br>2006-2010 HUMMER H3<br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to add the 2010 model year. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 08-03-10-004 (Section 03 - Suspension). <br><br>This bulletin is intended to offer comprehensive instructions to GM Dealers and authorized GM Accessory Distributor/Installers as to the proper methods for mounting, balancing, and installing accessory <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/">wheels and tires</a>. Adherence to these methods will ensure that the vehicle delivered to the customer is of the highest quality.<br><br><b>Tire Pressure Monitor (TPM) Sensor Installation</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Clean any dirt or debris from the grommet sealing area.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/123576736.png"></div><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Insert the sensor in the wheel hole with the air passage facing away from the wheel<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Install the sensor nut and position the sensor body parallel to the inside wheel surface while tightening the nut.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Tighten</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tighten the sensor nut to 7 Nm (62 lb in).<br><br><b>Tire Mounting</b><br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>When mounting the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a>, use the approved tire mounting lubricant. DO NOT use silicon or corrosive base compounds to lubricate the tire bead and the wheel rim. A silicon base compound can allow the tire to slip on the rim resulting in imbalance or braking failure. A corrosive type compound can cause tire or rim deterioration.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that the tire is at least 15&deg;C (60&deg;F) prior to mounting and inflating.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Apply GM Vehicle Care Rubber Lubricant, P/N 12345884 (Canadian P/N 5728223), to both of the tire beads and both of the wheel bead hump areas for full circumference. <br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Mounting operation and wheel assembly must be completed within 15 minutes of applying lubricant to ensure proper assembly and inflation.

The bead may break when the bead snaps over the safety hump. Do not exceed 40 psi (275 kPa) pressure when inflating any tire if beads are not seated. If 40 psi (275 kPa) pressure will not seat the beads, deflate, relubricate the beads and reinflate. If greater than 40 psi (275 kPa) is required to install the tire on the wheel, a safety cage must be used.

Some GM Accessory wheels may be flangeless on the inboard side. In this case, follow the instructions for applying adhesive balanced weights.

This is very important to achieve proper adhesion.<br><br><b>Balance Weight Limits</b><br><br>When dynamically balancing a wheel and tire assembly, the maximum amount of balance weight that should be used at any one location on a wheel is 5 oz (141 g).

If the relearn procedure is not performed properly, the module will continue to try to communicate with the original sensors that were removed from the vehicle. This will result in the vehicle displaying a TPM system malfunction message once the vehicle is removed from the proximity of the original sensors for an extended period of time. Please see the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tire%2520Monitoring%2520System/Tire%2520Pressure%2520Sensor/index.html">Tire Pressure Sensor</a> Learn procedure in SI for the vehicle specific instructions.<br><br><b>Tire Inflation Pressure and Placards</b><br><br><b>Tire Placard</b><br><br>When installing GM Accessory <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/">wheels and tires</a> on a vehicle, the new tire pressure placard (supplied with the GM Accessory wheel kit) must be installed over the existing placard inside the driver's side door frame. This is required when the size of the GM Accessory <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> is different than those being removed from the vehicle.<br><br>The new tire placard should be located within the red box, over the top of the original tire label found on the door jamb. To locate the placard within the red box use the upper left hand edge of the red line as a guide. When properly placed, the new tire placard will obscure the original tire information. Be sure that the surface is clean and dry, and the surface temperature is not less than 21&deg;C (65&deg;F). <br><br><b>Tire Inflation Pressure</b><br><br>Note the front, rear, and spare (where applicable) tire inflation pressures shown on the new tire placard. The inflation pressure of new <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> on the vehicle must be adjusted to the values shown on the placard. Even if the tire size was not changed on the vehicle and the tire pressure placard was not replaced, all of the tires must have their inflation pressures adjusted to match those shown on tire pressure placard.<br><br><b>Electronic Module Reprogramming for Proper Tire Inflation Pressure</b><br><br>When GM Accessory <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/">wheels and tires</a> are installed on a vehicle that requires a different tire inflation pressure according to the Tire Inflation Placard, the vehicle must be updated with the new pressure and tire type (P or LT). If this is not done the vehicle will incorrectly report low or high tire pressure conditions incorrectly. Please see the Corporate Bulletin specific to the vehicle and wheel/tire application for detailed information on updating of the tire type/pressure.<br><br><b>Other Electronic Module Reprogramming</b><br><br>For proper vehicle operation and to ensure coverage under the provisions of the new vehicle warranty, the vehicle may require that certain control modules be reprogrammed with the correct calibrations as soon as the GM Accessory <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/">wheels and tires</a> are installed. Examples of the modules that may be affected are Electronic Brake Control Module (for proper anti-lock brake and stability control performance) and Engine Control Module (for proper speedometer/odometer function).<br><br>Please see the Corporate Bulletin specific to the vehicle and wheel/tire application for detailed information on module reprogramming.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br></div>
