A thorough inspection of the area around the leak may assist in determining the cause of the leak.<br><br><b>Oil Seals</b><br><br>Lubricant leaks from a oil seal may be caused by any of the following:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>An improperly installed seal<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A distorted seal<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A worn seal<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A worn shaft<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A brittle seal lip<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A hardened seal lip<br><br>To determine the actual cause of the leak, clean the area around the leak. Observe the area of the leak and determine the if the seal or another component is causing the leak. A worn seal surface will cause a leak at the sealing lip while a misaligned seal or a seal installed into a housing with an excessive bore will cause the seal to leak at the outside surface of the seal. Hardened or cracked seal lips usually indicate the axle is operating beyond the normal temperature limits for the axle. A seal whose sealing surface has been nicked or cut may indicate that the shaft has a rough, burred, or gouged surface and will need to be inspected before the seal can be replaced.<br><br><b>Gaskets</b><br><br>A leak at a gasket is usually caused by a poor fit of the components on each side of the gasket surface. Inspect each component for distortion and for nicks or gouges that may prohibit the gasket from sealing properly.<br><br><b>Rear Axle Housing</b><br><br>Rear axle housing lubricant leaks usually occur at the following locations:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drain Plug<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fill Plug<br><br>Drain and fill plug leaks are usually caused by a loose plug. These leaks can by repaired by either tightening the plug or by using an approved sealer on the threads on the plug.<br><br>Other leaks such as axle tube to <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Transmission%20and%20Drivetrain/Differential%20Assembly/Differential%20Carrier/">differential carrier</a> housing or porosity leaks require the replacement of the rear axle housing.<br><br></div>
