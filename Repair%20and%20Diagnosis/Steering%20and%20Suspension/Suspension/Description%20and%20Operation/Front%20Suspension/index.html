<h1>Front Suspension</h1><br><br><b>General Description</b><br><br>The front <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> allows each wheel to compensate for changes in the road surface without affecting the opposite wheel. Each wheel independently connects to the frame with a <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/">steering</a> knuckle, <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Suspension/Ball%2520Joint/index.html">ball joint</a> assemblies, and upper and lower control arms.<br><br>Two <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/Tie%20Rod/">tie rods</a> connect to the steering arms on the knuckles and to a <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/Steering%20Gear/">steering gear</a>. <br><br>Rear wheel drive models have a front <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> that consists of the following components:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Suspension/Control%2520Arm/index.html">Control arms</a><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Stabilizer shaft<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Shock/Coil spring modules<br><br>The upper part of each Shock/Coil spring module bolts to the frame. Three insulators, a mounting plate and a nut secure the coil spring to the shock housing. Two bolts secure the lower part of the shock module to the lower control arm.<br><br>A spring steel stabilizer shaft controls the side roll of the front <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a>. This shaft is mounted in rubber insulators that are held by clamps to the frame side rails. The ends of the stabilizer shaft connect to the lower control arms with link assemblies.<br><br>The upper <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Suspension/Ball%2520Joint/index.html">ball joint</a> assembly is integrated into the upper <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Suspension/Control%2520Arm/index.html">control arm</a>.

The assembly attaches to the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/">steering</a> knuckle with a prevailing torque nut.<br><br>The upper and the lower control arms have pressed-in bushings. The bolts pass through the bushings and join the arms to the frame. <br><br><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Suspension/Ball%2520Joint/index.html">Ball joint</a> assemblies have rubber grease seals. These seals prevent the entry of moisture and dirt. This prevents damage to the bearing surfaces.<br><br>Four-wheel drive models have a front <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> that consists of the following components:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Suspension/Control%2520Arm/index.html">Control arms</a><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Stabilizer shaft<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Shock module/Shock absorbers<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Coil Springs (1500 series)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Suspension/Torsion%2520Bar/index.html">Torsion bars</a> (2500, 3500 series)<br><br>The upper part of each shock absorber (2500, 3500 series) extends through a frame bracket. Two insulators and a nut secure the upper part of the shock to the frame. A through bolt secures the lower part of the shock to the lower control arm.<br><br>The upper part of each shock module (1500 series) attaches to the frame by 3 nuts. The lower part of the shock module attaches to the lower control arm by 2 bolts.<br><br>A spring steel stabilizer shaft controls the side roll of the front <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a>.

The rear of the torsion bar mounts into an adjustable arm at the torsion bar crossmember. This arm adjustment controls the vehicle trim height.<br><br>Both RWD and 4WD models have sealed front <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Drive%2520Axles%252C%2520Bearings%2520and%2520Joints/Wheel%2520Bearing/index.html">wheel bearings</a>.
