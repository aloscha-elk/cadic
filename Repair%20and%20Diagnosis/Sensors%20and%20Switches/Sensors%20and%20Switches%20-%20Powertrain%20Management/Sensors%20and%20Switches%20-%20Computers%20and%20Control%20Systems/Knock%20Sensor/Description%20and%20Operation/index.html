<h1>Knock Sensor: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>KNOCK SENSOR (KS) SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</b><br><br><b>PURPOSE</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The knock sensor (KS) system enables the control module to control the ignition timing for the best possible performance while protecting the engine from potentially damaging levels of detonation. The control module uses the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Ignition%2520System/Knock%2520Sensor/index.html">KS</a> system to test for abnormal engine noise that may indicate detonation, also known as spark knock.<br><br><b>SENSOR DESCRIPTION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>This knock sensor (KS) system uses one or 2 flat response 2-wire sensors. The sensor uses piezo-electric crystal technology that produces an AC voltage signal of varying amplitude and frequency based on the engine vibration or noise level. The control module receives the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Ignition%2520System/Knock%2520Sensor/index.html">KS</a> signal through a signal circuit. The KS ground is supplied by the control module through a low reference circuit.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The control module learns a minimum noise level, or background noise, at idle from the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Ignition%2520System/Knock%2520Sensor/index.html">KS</a> and uses calibrated values for the rest of the RPM range. The control module uses the minimum noise level to calculate a noise channel. A normal KS signal will ride within the noise channel. As engine speed and load change, the noise channel upper and lower parameters will change to accommodate the normal KS signal, keeping the signal within the channel. In order to determine which cylinders are knocking, the control module only uses KS signal information when each cylinder is near top dead center (TDC) of the firing stroke. If knock is present, the signal will range outside of the noise channel.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If the control module has determined that knock is present, it will retard the ignition timing to attempt to eliminate the knock. The control module will always try to work back to a zero compensation level, or no spark retard. An abnormal <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Ignition%2520System/Knock%2520Sensor/index.html">KS</a> signal will stay outside of the noise channel or will not be present. KS diagnostics are calibrated to detect faults with the KS circuitry inside the control module, the KS wiring, or the KS voltage output. Some diagnostics are also calibrated to detect constant noise from an outside influence such as a loose/damaged component or excessive engine mechanical noise.</div>
