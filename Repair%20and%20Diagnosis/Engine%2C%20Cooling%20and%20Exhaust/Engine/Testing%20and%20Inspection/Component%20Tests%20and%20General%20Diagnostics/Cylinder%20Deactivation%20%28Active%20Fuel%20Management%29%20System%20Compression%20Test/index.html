The system is inactive for the 2007 model year.</b><br><br>The Active Fuel Management System Compression Test is a functional test of the valve lifter oil manifold and valve lifters. Using a compression gage, the technician can monitor the specific cylinders ability to go into and out of active fuel management as commanded by the scan tool. The actual pressure values on the compression gage are not as critical as is observing the on-off switching action of the solenoid and valve lifters. <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Measure the engine oil level.
