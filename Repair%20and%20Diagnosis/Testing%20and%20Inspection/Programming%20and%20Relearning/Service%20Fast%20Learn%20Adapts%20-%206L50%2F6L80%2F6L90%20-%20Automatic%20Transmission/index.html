<h1>Service Fast Learn Adapts - 6L50/6L80/6L90 - Automatic Transmission</h1><br><br><b>Service Fast Learn Adapts</b><br><br>Service Fast Learn Adapts is a procedure for 6 speed automatic transmissions in which a series of tests are run to allow the transmission control module (TCM) to learn individual clutch characteristics. Once the clutch data is learned, Service Fast Learn Adapts translates it into the adaptive data cells, which the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Transmission%2520Control%2520Systems/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520A%252FT/Control%2520Module/index.html">TCM</a> uses for clutch control during shifts. The scan tool provides initiation of the Service Fast Learn Adapts procedure. This procedure is to be used following transmission repair. <br><br>The Service Fast Learn Adapts procedure must be performed when one of the following repairs have been made to the vehicle. Failure to perform the procedure after one of the following repairs may result in poor transmission performance, as well as transmission DTCs being set:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Transmission internal service/overhaul<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Valve body repair or replacement<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Control solenoid (w/body and <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Transmission%2520Control%2520Systems/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520A%252FT/Control%2520Module/index.html">TCM</a>) valve assembly replacement<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Transmission%2520Control%2520Systems/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520A%252FT/Control%2520Module/index.html">TCM</a> software/calibration update<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Any service in response to a shift quality concern<br><br><b>Important:</b> <b>Ensure the following conditions are met before performing the Service Fast Learn Adapts procedure:</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Drive wheels are blocked</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Parking brake is applied</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Service brake is applied</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Zero percent throttle and no external engine RPM control</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Transmission fluid temperature (TFT) is between 70-100&deg; C (158-212&deg; F)</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Transmission gear selector has been cycled from Park to Reverse 3 times in order to purge air from the reverse clutches.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use the scan tool to navigate to Service Fast Learn Adapts by selecting the following commands:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>F3: Special Function<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>F1: Transmission Output Controls<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Service Fast Learn Adapts<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b> <b>If at any time during the procedure, required conditions are not met, Service Fast Learn Adapts may abort and the process may need to be started again from the beginning.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use the scan tool to perform the Service Fast Learn Adapts procedure.<br><br><b>Important:</b> <b>There are 3 stages required to successfully complete the Service Fast Learn Adapts procedure:</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>PARK test setup</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>DRIVE mode</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>REVERSE mode</b><br><br><b>These stages are automatically initiated and controlled by the scan tool.

The test preparation will include the diagnostic criteria checks, safety checks, vehicle status checks, and then will perform internal transmission test preparation functions such as clutch air purging. The scan tool will instruct the operator to select park and apply the brake only.<br><br><b>DRIVE Mode</b><br><br><b>Caution: Block the wheels before selecting DRIVE. While in DRIVE, if the Scan Tool loses communication or becomes disconnected, the vehicle could move forward. Failure to block the wheels could result in personal injury or property damage.</b><br><br>Once the PARK setup has completed, the scan tool instructs the driver to select DRIVE. Once DRIVE is selected, the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Transmission%2520Control%2520Systems/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520A%252FT/Control%2520Module/index.html">TCM</a> engages the individual clutches to learn the clutch volume, full feed fill thresholds, and pressure offsets.
