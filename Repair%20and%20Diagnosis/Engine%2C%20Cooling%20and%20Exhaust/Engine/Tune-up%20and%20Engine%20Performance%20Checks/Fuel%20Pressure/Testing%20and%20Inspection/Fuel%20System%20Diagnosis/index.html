<h1>Fuel System Diagnosis</h1><br><br><b>FUEL SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS</b><br><br><b>DIAGNOSTIC FAULT INFORMATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Perform the Diagnostic System Check - Vehicle prior to using this diagnostic procedure.  <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Initial%20Inspection%20and%20Diagnostic%20Overview/">Initial Inspection and Diagnostic Overview</a><br><br><b>CIRCUIT/SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the ignition is turned ON, the engine control module (ECM) supplies power to the in-tank fuel pump, by energizing the fuel pump relay. The in-tank fuel pump remains ON as long as the engine is cranking or running and the ECM receives crankshaft reference pulses. If there are no reference pulses, the ECM turns the in-tank fuel pump OFF, <b>2 seconds</b> after the ignition switch is turned ON or <b>2 seconds</b> after the engine stops running. The electric fuel pump is incorporated into the modular fuel pump and sender assembly and is located inside the fuel tank. The fuel pump supplies fuel through a <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Tune-up%20and%20Engine%20Performance%20Checks/Fuel%20Filter/">fuel filter</a>, also located in the modular fuel pump and sender assembly, through the fuel feed pipes, to the fuel rail assembly. The fuel pump provides fuel at a pressure above the pressure needed by the fuel injectors. The fuel pressure regulator, located in the modular fuel pump and sender assembly, keeps the fuel available to the fuel injectors at a regulated pressure. When the <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Tune-up%2520and%2520Engine%2520Performance%2520Checks/Fuel%2520Pressure/index.html">fuel pressure</a> rises above the pressure regulator calibration, the pressure is relieved, with excess fuel exhausted into the modular fuel pump and sender assembly reservoir.<br><br><b>CIRCUIT/SYSTEM VERIFICATION</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>IMPORTANT:</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Inspect the fuel system for damage or external leaks before proceeding.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Verify that adequate fuel is in the fuel tank before proceeding.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The fuel pump relay may need to be commanded ON a few times in order to obtain the highest possible <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Tune-up%2520and%2520Engine%2520Performance%2520Checks/Fuel%2520Pressure/index.html">fuel pressure</a>.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition ON, command the fuel pump relay ON with a scan tool.
