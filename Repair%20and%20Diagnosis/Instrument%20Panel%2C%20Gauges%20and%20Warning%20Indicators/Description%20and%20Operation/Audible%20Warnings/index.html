<h1>Audible Warnings</h1><br><br><b>AUDIBLE WARNINGS DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION</b><br><br>The audible warnings alert the driver of a system concern or a critical vehicle condition. The radio generates the audible warnings through the left front speaker. The radio receives audible warning requests via the GMLAN serial data circuit. If the radio receives multiple audible warning requests, the warning with the highest priority sounds first. On vehicles without a radio, a chime module generates the audible warnings and receives audible warning requests via GMLAN. Either the radio or the chime module is the chime procedure. The following lists the audible warning priority and the pulse rate:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fast rate chime-200 pulses per minute<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Medium rate chime-150 pulses per minute<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Slow rate chime-50 pulses per minute<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Single chime<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Fasten Safety Belt Warning</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The chime producer activates the fasten safety belt audible warning as requested by the body control module (BCM). The BCM sends a GMLAN message to the audio amplifier indicating the chime frequency at a slow rate and a duration of <b>8 seconds</b>. The fasten safety belt warning sounds and the fasten safety belt indicator illuminates when the following occurs:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition switch transitions to ON.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The inflatable restraint sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) detects that the drivers seat belt is not buckled and the signal is low. The SDM sends a GMLAN message to the BCM indicating the seat belt status. The instrument panel cluster (IPC) receives a GMLAN message from the BCM indicating the driver seat belt status.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If the seat belt is buckled when the ignition is turned ON, the chime does not sound. If the seat belt is buckled while the chime is sounding, the chime stops. If the seat belt is unbuckled after the initial transition to ON, the chime does not sound.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Lights On Warning</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The chime producer activates the lights on warning as requested by the body control module (BCM). The BCM sends a GMLAN message to the chime producer indicating the chime frequency of a fast rate and at a continuous duration. The lights on warning sounds when the following occurs:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition is OFF.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The BCM determines that the driver door is open and the signal circuit is low.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The BCM determines that the headlamp switch is in the park or head position.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Brake Warning</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The chime producer activates the brake audible warning as requested by the instrument panel cluster (IPC). The IPC sends a GMLAN message to the chime producer indicating the chime frequency of a fast rate and at a continuous duration. The brake warning sounds and the BRAKE indicator illuminates when the following occurs:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition is ON.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle speed is greater than <b>8 km/h (4.9 mph)</b>. The IPC receives a GMLAN message from the engine control module (ECM) indicating the vehicle speed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The IPC determines that the park brake is engaged and the signal circuit is low.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The brake fluid is low.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The Traction Control System (TCS) and the Vehicle Stability Enhancement System (VSES) have failed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Key-In-Ignition Warning</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The chime producer activates the key-in-ignition audible warning as requested by the body control module (BCM). The BCM sends a GMLAN message to the chime producer indicating the chime frequency of a medium rate and continuous duration. The key-in-ignition warning sounds when the following occurs:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition switch is OFF.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The BCM determines that the driver door is open and the signal circuit is low. The IPC also receives a GMLAN message from the BCM indicating the door ajar status<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The BCM determines that the key-in-ignition switch is open and the signal circuit is high. The IPC receives a GMLAN message from the BCM indicating the key-in-ignition status.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Door Ajar Warning</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The chime producer activates the door ajar audible warning as requested by the body control module (BCM). The BCM sends a GMLAN message to the chime producer indicating the chime frequency of a medium rate and continuous duration. The door ajar warning sounds and the appropriate door ajar indicator illuminates in the drivers information center (DIC) when the following occurs:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The BCM determines that a door (driver door, passenger door, left rear door, right rear door) is open and the signal circuit is low. The IPC also receives a GMLAN message from the BCM indicating the door ajar status.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle is not in PARK. The BCM receives a GMLAN message from the engine control module (ECM)/BCM indicating the gear position.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Additional Warnings</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The following warnings have an associated instrument panel cluster (IPC) indicator or driver information center (DIC) message:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine Overheated Stop Engine Message-The chime producer activates the audible warning as requested by the BCM.
