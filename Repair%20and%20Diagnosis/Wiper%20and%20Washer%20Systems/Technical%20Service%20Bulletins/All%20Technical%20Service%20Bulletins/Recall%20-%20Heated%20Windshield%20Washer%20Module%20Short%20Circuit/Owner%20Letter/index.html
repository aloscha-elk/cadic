<h1>Owner Letter</h1>Owner Letter<br><br>Dear General Motors Customer:<br><br>This notice is sent to you in accordance with the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. <br><br>General Motors has decided that a defect that relates to motor vehicle safety exists in certain 2006-2009 model year Buick Lucerne; Cadillac DTS; HUMMER H2; 2008-2009 model year Buick Enclave; Cadillac CTS; 2007-2009 model year Cadillac Escalade, Escalade ESV, Escalade EXT; Chevrolet Avalanche, Silverado, Suburban, Tahoe; GMC Acadia, Sierra, Yukon, Yukon XL; Saturn OUTLOOK; and 2009 model year Chevrolet Traverse vehicles equipped with a heated washer fluid system (HWFS). As a result, GM is conducting a safety recall. We apologize for this inconvenience. However, we are concerned about your safety and continued satisfaction with our products. <br><br><b>Important</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Your vehicle is involved in safety recall 10153.</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Schedule an appointment with your GM dealer/retailer.</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>This service will be performed for you at no charge.</b><br><br><b>Why is your vehicle being recalled? </b><br><br>A recall was implemented on some vehicles in 2008 to add a fuse to the HWFS control circuit harness to address the potential consequences of a printed circuit board electrical short. However, there have been new reports of thermal incidents on HWFS modules after this improvement was installed. These incidents resulted from a new failure mode attributed to the device's thermal protection feature. Their significance varies from minor distortion to considerable melting of the plastic around the HWFS fluid chamber. In some circumstances, it is possible for the heated washer module to cause a fire. <br><br><b>What will we do?</b><br><br>Your GM dealer/retailer will permanently disable and remove the heated washer fluid system. In addition, because the heated washer feature will be disabled, the dealer will provide a customer satisfaction payment of $100 to the customer. This service will be performed for you at <b>no charge</b>. Because of service scheduling requirements, it is likely that your dealer/retailer will need your vehicle longer than the actual service correction time of approximately 20 minutes. <br><br>An updated page for your Owner Manual will be provided and inserted at the time of service to document that the feature has been permanently disabled and removed from your vehicle. <br><br>If your vehicle is within the New Vehicle Limited Warranty, your dealer/retailer may provide you with shuttle service or some other form of courtesy transportation while your vehicle is at the dealership/facility for this repair. Please refer to your Owner Manual and your dealer/retailer for details on courtesy transportation. <br><br><b>What should you do?</b><br><br>You should contact your GM dealer/retailer to arrange a service appointment as soon as possible. <br><br><b>Did you already pay for this repair?</b><br><br>The enclosed form explains what reimbursement is available and how to request reimbursement if you have paid for repairs for the recall condition. Even though you may have already had this condition repaired in the past, you will still need to take your vehicle to your dealer/retailer for this recall. <br><br><b>Do you have questions?</b><br><br>If you have questions or concerns that your dealer/retailer is unable to resolve, please contact the GM Customer Assistance Center. More information about your vehicle can be found at the GM Owner Center at www.gmownercenter.com.<br><br>If after contacting your dealer/retailer and the Customer Assistance Center, you are still not satisfied we have done our best to remedy this condition without charge and within a reasonable time, you may wish to write the Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, Washington DC 20590, or call the toll-free Vehicle Safety Hotline at 1.888.327.4236 (TTY 1.800.424.9153), or go to http://www.safercar.gov. <br><br>Federal regulation requires that any vehicle lessor receiving this recall notice must forward a copy of this notice to the lessee within ten days.<br><br>Scott Lawson <br><br>Director, <br><br>Customer and Relationship Services<br><br>Enclosure<br><br>10153<br>Owner Letter<br><br>September 2008<br><br>Dear General Motors Customer:<br><br>This notice is sent to you in accordance with the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. <br><br>General Motors has decided that a defect, which relates to motor vehicle safety, exists in certain 2006-2008 model year Buick Lucerne; Cadillac DTS; HUMMER H2 vehicles; 2007-2008 model year Cadillac Escalade, Escalade ESV, Escalade EXT; Chevrolet Avalanche, Silverado, Suburban, Tahoe; GMC Acadia, Sierra, Yukon, Yukon XL; Saturn OUTLOOK vehicles; and 2008 model year Buick Enclave vehicles equipped with a heated washer fluid system.
