<h1>Battery Charging</h1><br><br><b>BATTERY CHARGING</b><br><br><b>TOOLS REQUIRED</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>J 42000 Battery Tester<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For best results, use an automatic taper-rate battery charger with a voltage capability of <b>16 volts</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The charging area should be well ventilated.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not charge a battery that appears to be frozen. Allow the battery to warm to room temperature and test it using the J 42000 before charging.<br><br><b>BATTERY STATE OF CHARGE</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  Using voltage to determine the batteries state of charge (SOC) is only accurate after the battery has been at rest for <b>24 hours</b>. This is enough time for the acid in each cell to equalize. If the battery has been charged or discharged in the past <b>24 hours</b>, the battery SOC will only be an estimate.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The maintenance-free batteries SOC is estimated by reading the voltage of the battery across the battery terminals. Because the voltage is affected by current flow into or out of the battery, the engine must be stopped and all electrical loads turned OFF, including parasitic loads, when checking the voltage. The voltage can also be affected if the battery has just been charged or discharged, so it is important to consider what has happened to the battery in the time just before testing. Use the following procedure to determine the batteries SOC:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Be sure all electrical loads are turned OFF.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Determine whether the battery has been used in a vehicle or charged within the past <b>12 hours</b>.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the answer is no, the terminal voltage will be stabilized and no action is necessary before reading the voltage. Skip to step 3.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the answer is yes, terminal voltage will not be stabilized and you should wait <b>12 hours</b> since the last time the battery was used.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Estimate the battery temperature by determining the average temperature to which the battery has been exposed for the past <b>12 hours</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  The table is accurate to <b>10 percent</b> only after the battery has been at rest for <b>12 hours</b>.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/443501239.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Measure the battery voltage at the battery terminals. Refer to the table to determine the SOC according to the estimated battery temperature.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Use the SOC information as follows:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A battery with a SOC that is below <b>65 percent</b> must always be recharged before returning it to service or continuing storage.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A battery with a SOC that is <b>65 percent</b> or greater is generally considered to be charged enough in order to be returned to normal service or in order to continue storage. However, if the battery is being used in slow traffic or with short drive times, or if the temperature is very hot or very cold, the battery should be fully charged, to at least <b>90 percent</b>, before returning it to service or continuing storage.<br><br><b>CHARGING TIME REQUIRED</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The time required to charge a battery will vary depending upon the following factors:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The battery charger capacity-The higher the charger amperage, the less time it will take to charge the battery.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The SOC of the battery-A completely discharged battery requires more than twice as much charging time as a half charged battery. In a discharged battery with a voltage below <b>11 volts</b>, the battery has a very high internal resistance and may only accept a very low current at first. Later, as the charging current causes the acid content to increase in the electrolyte, the charging current will increase. Extremely discharged batteries may not activate the reversed voltage protection in some chargers. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for operating this circuitry.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The temperature of the battery-The colder the battery is, the more time it takes to recharge the battery. The charging current accepted by a cold battery is very low at first. As the battery warms, the charging current will increase.<br><br><b>CHARGING PROCEDURE</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn OFF the ignition when connecting or disconnecting the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Starting%20and%20Charging/Battery/Battery%20Cable/">battery cables</a>, the battery charger or the jumper cables. Failure to do so may damage the PCM or other electronic components.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Refer to Fastener Notice.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When charging side-terminal batteries with the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Starting%20and%20Charging/Battery/Battery%20Cable/">battery cables</a> connected, connect the charger to the positive cable bolt and to a ground located away from the battery. When charging side-terminal batteries with the battery cables disconnected, install the battery side terminal adapters and connect the charger to the adapters.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Tighten the battery side terminal adapters to <b>15 N.m (11 lb ft)</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Use the following procedure to charge the battery:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn OFF the charger.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ensure that all of the battery terminal connections are clean and tight.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connect the charger positive lead to the battery positive terminal on the battery or the remote jumper stud underhood.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b>  Do not connect the negative charger lead to the housings of other vehicle electrical accessories or equipment. The action of the battery charger may damage such equipment.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connect the negative charger lead to a solid engine ground or to a ground stud in the engine compartment that is connected directly to the battery negative terminal, but away from the battery. If the negative <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Starting%20and%20Charging/Battery/Battery%20Cable/">battery cable</a> is disconnected and a terminal adapter is being used, connect directly to the adapter.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn ON the charger and set to the highest setting for normal charging.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the battery every half hour after starting the battery charger.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Charge the battery until the taper-rate charger indicates that the battery is fully charged.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Estimate the battery temperature by feeling the side of the battery. If it feels hot to the touch or its temperature is over <b>45&deg;C (125&deg;F)</b>, discontinue charging and allow the battery to cool before resuming charging.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After charging, test the battery.
