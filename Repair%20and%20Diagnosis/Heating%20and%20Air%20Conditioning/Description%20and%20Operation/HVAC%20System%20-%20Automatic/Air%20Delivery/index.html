The auxiliary HVAC control module can not request A/C operation from the powertrain control module (PCM).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Air Distribution</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The HVAC control module controls the distribution of air by the use of a mode actuator. The modes that may be selected are:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Defrost<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Defog<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Panel<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>BI-Level<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Floor<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The mode actuator is connected to the mode door by a cam type linkage system. Depending on the position of the door, air is directed through the HVAC module and distributed through various ducts leading to the outlets in the dash. If the HVAC control module detects a fault with the mode door the HVAC control module will try to drive the actuator for a predetermined amount of time, to defrost, which is the defaulted position for the mode door actuator. When the mode switch is placed in the defrost or defog positions the A/C is commanded on and the recirculation door is moved to the outside air position to help reduce window fogging. A/C is available in all modes and recirculation is only available in the panel and bi-level modes.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Mode Actuator</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The mode actuator is an electronic stepper motor with feedback potentiometers. The HVAC control module sends signals to the mode door actuator through the mode door control circuit. Zero volts drive the actuator in one direction while <b>5 volts</b> move the actuator in the opposite direction. When the actuator receives <b>2.5 volts</b>, the actuator rotation stops. A <b>5-Volt</b> reference signal is sent out over the <b>5-Volt</b> reference circuit to the mode actuator. When you select a desired mode setting, logic determines the value of the mode actuator signals. The HVAC control modules software uses this reference voltage in order to determine the position of the mode actuator through the mode door position signal circuit. The motor moves the mode door to the desired position.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Front Defrost</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When defrost is selected, the A/C compressor is activated. The A/C compressor clutch will engage when ambient temperatures are above 3&deg;C (38 F). The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Blower%2520Motor/index.html">blower motor</a> will be activated, regardless of the coolant temperature. The HVAC control module will override the auxiliary HVAC control module so a high volume of air is delivered to the front defrost vents. The rear window defogger does not affect the HVAC system.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Air Distribution - Auxiliary Control</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The auxiliary HVAC system provides ventilation for the rear seat occupants. The rear seat occupants will exercise control of the auxiliary air delivery modes, air speed and air temperature setting.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the auxiliary mode switch is toggled, a signal is sent to the auxiliary mode actuator through the auxiliary mode door control circuit. Power and ground are supplied to the auxiliary mode actuator through the ignition 3 voltage and ground circuits.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>A rocker type switch on the RSA control module provides the operator the ability to select several blower speeds. The RSA control module uses a bar graph to indicate the selected blower speed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Recirculation Operation</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The HVAC control module controls the air intake through the recirculation actuator. The recirculation switch closes the recirculation door in order to circulate the air within the vehicle. The outside air switch opens the recirculation door in order to route outside air into the vehicle. Regardless of the <a>blower motor switch</a> position, recirculation is available only in the panel and bi-level mode switch positions. Including the OFF position. The mode switch must be placed in either the panel or bi-level position before the blower motor switch is placed in the OFF position. In order to reduce windshield fogging, outside air is circulated when the mode switch is in the defrost or defog positions. If the recirculation switch is pressed into the ON position when the mode switch is in an unavailable mode position, then the recirculation switch LED will flash 3 times. If the HVAC control module detects a fault with the recirc door the HVAC control module will try to drive the actuator for a predetermined amount of time, to outside air, which is the defaulted position for the recirculation actuator.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Automatic Operation</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>In automatic operation, the HVAC control module will maintain the comfort level inside of the vehicle by controlling the A/C compressor clutch, the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Blower%2520Motor/index.html">blower motor</a>, the air temperature actuators, mode actuator and circulation.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>To place the HVAC system in Automatic mode, the following is required:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The Auto switch must be activated<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The air temperature switch must be in any other position other than full hot or full cold position<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Once the desired temperature is reached, the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Blower%2520Motor/index.html">blower motor</a>, mode, recirculation and temperature actuators will automatically be adjusted to maintain the temperature selected.

The outside air temperature (OAT) sensor on automatic systems, is utilized to determine the moding of the following features: Blower Mode (Bi-level, Floor, Defrost, Recirc and Rear Defrost. These features are determined by the IAT during activation sequence and are maintained for the duration of engine run time. Calibratable temperatures are utilized to provide low, mid and high temperature ranges for the selectable feature. Blower and mode have the range to select any valid feature positions. When the remote start active serial data is received, ignition-OFF loop HVAC algorithms will act the same as if a run power mode was received, i.e. re-calibration, afterblow, ignition-OFF motor positioning etc. The OFF timer and the ignition ON timer have the functionality as in the Run mode.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Remote Start De-activation</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the remote start is exited, GMLAN power mode equals run mode or remote start engine. In the case of automatic settings, the displays will revert to the actual state of operation of the features, on the basis of their normal control algorithms.</div>
