<h1>Garage Door Opener Transmitter: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>GARAGE DOOR OPENER DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION</b><br><br>The garage door opener (GDO) is located in the overhead console or drivers side sunshade. If battery voltage is lost due to a condition such as a dead battery, the GDO unit relies on the non-serviceable internal power backup supply. The unit is programmed using the customer's hand-held transmitters for the garage doors, electric entrance gates, or lighting and security systems.<br><br>The GDO is rolling code capable. Rolling code is a system that allows the code that the customers receiver receives from the GDO to change every time the GDO is used within operating range of the receiver. Rolling code programming requires the customer to push a learn/program button on the GDO receiver at their home. This button is usually located on the receiver unit under a cover (light cover) on one end of the unit. The customer must follow the GDO manufacturers instructions to program/learn the receiver to accept the HomeLink as an authorized opener for their unit. When the receiver and the GDO are initially programmed together, a code is established and a new code is created for every new transmission. The software in the receiver recognizes the GDO and accepts the new code.<br><br>The GDO is compatible with most, but not all types and brands of transmitters. If a problem should occur with a compatibility conflict with a transmitter, call HomeLink(TM) at 1-800-355-3515.<br><br>The GDO is a transmitter operating between 288-399 MHz. The power and range of the transmitter is limited to comply with laws governing the generation of radio frequency interference (RFI). The transmitter is programmed by the user to accept the signal generated by the user's transmitters. Refer to Control Module References for replacement, setup, and programming.<br><br>The GDO has 3 buttons that may be programmed for individual transmitter/receiver combinations to control up to 3 GDOs, security gates, and lighting systems. Each button represents a transmitter code section of the transmitter, which operates separately from any other button, and may be considered a separate transmitter. Operation consists of simply pressing a button to activate the corresponding transmitter.</div>
