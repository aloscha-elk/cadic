<h1>Tire Pressure Sensor Learn</h1><br><br><b><a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tire%2520Monitoring%2520System/Tire%2520Pressure%2520Sensor/index.html">Tire Pressure Sensor</a> Learn</b><br><br><b>Tools Required</b><br><br>J-46079 Tire Pressure Monitor Diagnostic Tool<br><br><b>TPM Learn Mode Description</b><br><br>The tire pressure monitor (TPM) system uses the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Accessories%2520and%2520Optional%2520Equipment/Radio%252C%2520Stereo%252C%2520and%2520Compact%2520Disc/Remote%2520Control/index.html">remote control</a> door lock receiver (RCDLR), exterior lamp switch, 4 RF transmitting pressure sensors and the serial data circuit to perform the TPM learn mode functions. The sensor learn procedure must be performed after every tire rotation, RCDLR replacement, or sensor replacement. Once the TPM learn mode has been enabled, each of the sensor's unique identification (ID) codes can be learned in to the RCDLR's memory. When a sensor ID has been learned, the RCDLR sends a serial data message to the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Body%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">BCM</a> to sound a <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Horn/">horn</a> chirp. This verifies the sensor has transmitted its ID and the RCDLR has received and learned it. The RCDLR must learn the sensor Ids in the proper order to determine correct sensor location. The first learned ID is assigned to the left front location, the second to right front, the third to right rear and the fourth to left rear.<br><br><b>Sensor Functions using pressure increase/decrease method</b><br><br>Each sensor takes a pressure measurement sample once every <b>30 seconds</b> while in stationary mode. If the tire pressure increases, or decreases by <b>more than 1.2 psi</b> from the last transmitted pressure, another measurement will occur immediately to verify the change in pressure. If a pressure change has indeed occurred, the sensor transmits in re-measure mode. When the RCDLR receives a re-measure mode transmission while in TPM learn mode, it will assign that sensor's ID to the location on the vehicle relative to the order in which it was learned.<br><br><b>Sensor functions using J-46079</b><br><br> Each sensor has an internal low frequency (LF) coil. When the J-46079 is used in activate mode it produces an LF transmission that activates the sensor. The sensor responds to a LF activation by transmitting in learn mode. When the RCDLR receives a learn mode transmission while in TPM learn mode, it will assign that sensor's ID to the location on the vehicle relative to the order in which it was learned. <br><br><b>TPM Learn Mode Cancellation</b><br><br>The learn mode will cancel if <b>more than 2 minutes</b> have passed and no sensor have been learned, or if <b>more than 5 minutes</b> has passed for the entire procedure. If the learn mode is canceled before any Ids are learned, the RCDLR will remember all previously stored Ids and their locations. As soon as the RCDLR learns the first ID, all other Ids are erased from the RCDLR's memory.<br><br><b>Important:</b> <b>Before proceeding with the steps below, ensure that no other sensor learn procedure is being performed simultaneously, or that tire pressures are not being adjusted on a TPM equipped vehicle within close proximity.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn ON the ignition, with the engine OFF.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Apply the parking brake.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b> <b>If the learn mode cannot be enabled, ensure the TPM system is enabled in the RCDLR.
