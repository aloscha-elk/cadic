The scan tool displays Entering Off, Exiting Off, Rolling, Re-measure, Learn. Entering Off indicates the sensors internal roll switch is opened and the sensor has made its stationary transmission which only occurs once every <b>60 minutes</b> from the last stationary transmission. Exiting Off indicates the sensor has transition to Rolling mode. In this mode the sensor has detected an initial roll switch closure. Rolling indicates the sensors internal roll switch has been closed for <b>at least 10 seconds.</b> In this mode the sensor is transmitting once every <b>60 seconds.</b> Re-measure indicates the sensor has detected a <b>8 KPa (1.2 psi)</b> change in tire pressure. This mode occurs to keep the system updated as to any changes in tire pressure. Learn indicates the sensor has been activated by a low frequency (LF) signal.
