These tires will alert the driver to a low pressure situation at roughly 262 kPa (38 psi) due to a requirement in FMVSS 138 which specifies a Minimum Activation Pressure for each tire type. This creates a relatively narrow window of "usable" pressure values and the warning will be more sensitive to outside temperature changes during the colder months.</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>As with other cold temperature/tire pressure issues, there is nothing wrong with the system itself. If a vehicle is brought in with this concern, check for tire damage and set all tires to the Recommended Cold Inflation Pressure shown on the vehicle placard. </b><br><br>Accurate tire pressures ensure the safe handling and appropriate ride characteristics of GM cars and trucks. It is critical that the tire pressure be adjusted to the specifications on the vehicle's tire placard during PDI.<br><br>Ride, handling and road noise concerns may be caused by improperly adjusted tire pressure.<br><br>The first step in the diagnosis of these concerns is to verify that the tires are inflated to the correct pressures. <b>The recommended tire inflation pressure is listed on the vehicle's tire placard.</b> The tire placard is located on the driver's side front or rear door edge, center pillar, or the rear compartment lid.<br><br><b>Tip</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Generally a 5.6&deg;C (10&deg;F) temperature increase will result in (is equivalent to) a 6.9 kPa (1 psi) tire pressure increase.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The definition of a "cold" tire is one that has been sitting for at least 3 hours, or driven no more than 1.6 km (1 mi).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>On extremely cold days, if the vehicle has been outdoors, it may be necessary to compensate for the low external temperature by adding additional air to the tire during PDI.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>During cold weather, the Tire Pressure Monitor (TPM) indicator light (a yellow horseshoe with an exclamation point) may illuminate.
