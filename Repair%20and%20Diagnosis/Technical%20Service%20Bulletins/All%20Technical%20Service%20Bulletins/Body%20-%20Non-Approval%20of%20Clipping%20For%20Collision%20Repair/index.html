<h1>Body - Non-Approval of Clipping For Collision Repair</h1>INFORMATION<br><br>Bulletin No.: 07-08-98-001A<br><br>Date: January 28, 2009<br><br>Subject: <br>Non-approval of "Clipping" (Sectioning of Two Vehicles) For Collision Repair<br><br>Models:<br>2000-2010 GM Passenger Cars and Trucks (Including Saturn and Saab)<br>2003-2010 HUMMER H2, H3, H3T<br><br>Supercede:<br><br>This bulletin is being revised to add model years through 2010. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 07-08-98-001 (Section 08 - Body and Accessories).<br><br>General Motors does not approve the use of "clipping" to repair collision damage to vehicles. In the collision repair industry, "clipping" refers to cutting two damaged vehicles through the windshield pillars, the rocker panels, and across the floor pan and joining the undamaged portions from these vehicles to make the repair.<br><br>The use of "clipping" voids GM's New Vehicle Limited Warranty (and any variety of the GM Protection Plan, as well as GM's new vehicle service part and corrosion warranties) for each part in the clip.<br><br>GM does not sanction clipping repair because it cuts across the major load-bearing paths of a vehicle and can reduce the structural integrity of the repaired vehicle. This is extremely critical because of the increase in the use of Advance High Strength Steel (AHSS). Improper repairs can lead to vehicle performance issues related to noise, vibration and handling problems.<br><br>GM recommends replacing body components at factory seams. When applicable, GM will provide a specific service part for collision repair frames, or provide repair information on how to create specific parts from a complete service assembly. <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Frame/">Frame</a> repair procedures for select GM vehicles are available at http://www.goodwrench.com/gmgoodwrenchjsp/gmspo/techrepair_index.jsp. These parts and procedures provide a practical and cost-effective alternative to clipping. GM provides vehicle specific collision repair procedures which are developed to be in a location and fashion that will yield panel strength comparable to the original panel strength. Replacing damaged parts of a vehicle designed to crush in a collision may reduce occupant protection in a future collision.<br><br>GM has not tested or validated a "clipped vehicle" repair; therefore, GM cannot endorse this type of repair or confirm the crash performance during a subsequent collision. GM recommends the use of genuine GM parts in repairs to help ensure the vehicle is returned to pre-collision condition.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer</div>
