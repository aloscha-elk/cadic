<h1>Cruise Control: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b><a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Cruise%2520Control/index.html">CRUISE CONTROL</a> DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION</b><br><br><a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Cruise%2520Control/index.html">Cruise control</a> is a speed control system that maintains a desired vehicle speed under normal driving conditions at speeds above <b>40 km/h (25 mph)</b>. Steep grades may cause variations in the selected vehicle speeds.<br><br>The following are the main components of the <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Cruise%2520Control/index.html">Cruise Control</a> System:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The accelerator pedal<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The stop lamp switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The body control module (BCM)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a>cruise control switches</a><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine control module (ECM)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The throttle actuator control (TAC) motor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle speed sensor (VSS)<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b><a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Cruise%2520Control/index.html">Cruise Control</a> Engaged</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The Cruise Control System will engage and adjust vehicle speeds, based on the activation of the following <a>cruise control switches</a>, which are located on the steering wheel:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The on/off switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The + RES switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The - SET switch<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The body control module (BCM) monitors the signal circuit of the <a>cruise control switches</a>. The BCM relays the cruise control switch status to the engine control module (ECM) via the GMLAN serial data circuit. The ECM uses the status of the cruise control switch to determine when to capture and maintain the vehicle speed. The ECM monitors the vehicle speed signal circuit in order to determine the desired vehicle speed. The ECM uses the throttle actuator control (TAC) motor in order to maintain the vehicle speed. For further information on the TAC System, refer to Throttle Actuator Control (TAC) System Description.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Voltage is supplied to the <a>cruise control switch</a> via the steering wheel control switch reference voltage circuit supplied by the BCM. The <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Cruise%2520Control/index.html">cruise control</a> function switches are arranged in a resistive ladder design, with each cruise control function switch having a different resistance value. The BCM detects a specific voltage value that is associated with the cruise control function switch being activated. When the normally open cruise control on/off switch is turned ON, the switch closes and the BCM supplies a ground to the cruise control switch ON indicator circuit as it becomes illuminated. The BCM sends a GMLAN serial data message to the ECM indicating that the on/off switch is active. Similarly, when the normally open + RES switch or the normally open - SET switch are pressed, the switch closes and the BCM detects the predetermined voltage signal on the cruise control set/coast and resume/accel switch signal circuit. The BCM sends a GMLAN serial data message to the ECM indicating that the + RES switch or the - SET switch is active. To engage the Cruise Control System, ensure that the vehicle speed is above 40.2 km/h (25 mph), turn the cruise On/Off switch ON and momentarily press the - SET switch. The ECM will engage the Cruise Control System and record the vehicle speed. The ECM sends a GMLAN serial data message to the driver information center (DIC) in order to illuminate the CRUISE SET TO ### message. The ECM sends a GMLAN serial data message to the instrument panel cluster (IPC) in order to illuminate the Cruise Engaged indicator in the IPC. The - SET switch and the + RES switch will remain inactive when the BCM has not received the predetermined voltage signal from the on/off switch. Pressing the accelerator pedal, while the Cruise Control System is engaged, will allow the driver to override the Cruise Control System in order to accelerate the vehicle beyond the current set vehicle speed. When the accelerator pedal is released, the vehicle will decelerate and resume the current set vehicle speed. The driver can also override the current set vehicle speed via the - SET switch and the + RES switch. When the Cruise Control System is engaged, pressing and holding the - SET switch will allow the vehicle to decelerate from the current set vehicle speed without deactivating the Cruise Control System. When the - SET switch is released, the ECM will record the vehicle speed and maintain the vehicle speed as the new set vehicle speed. When the Cruise Control System is engaged, momentarily pressing the - SET switch will allow the vehicle to decelerate at <b>1.6 km/h (1 mph)</b> increments for each time that the - SET is momentarily pressed, with a minimum vehicle speed of <b>37 km/h (23 mph)</b>. Pressing and holding the + RES switch, when the Cruise Control System is engaged, will allow the vehicle to accelerate to a greater vehicle speed than the current set vehicle speed. When the + RES switch is released, the ECM will record the vehicle speed and maintain the vehicle speed as the new set vehicle speed. When the Cruise Control System is engaged, momentarily pressing the + RES switch will allow the vehicle to accelerate at <b>1.6 km/h (1 mph)</b> increments for each time that the + RES switch is momentarily pressed, with the maximum acceleration total of <b>16 km/h (10 mph)</b> over the current set vehicle speed. Momentarily activating the + RES switch will recall the previous vehicle speed, after the cruise control system is disengaged by pressing the brake pedal or by activating the CANCEL switch.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b><a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Cruise%2520Control/index.html">Cruise Control</a> Disengaged</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The engine control module (ECM) disengages the cruise control operation based on the signals from the following switches:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The stop lamp switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Cruise%2520Control/index.html">cruise control</a> On/Off switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The cruise control cancel switch<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The body control module (BCM) determines when the <a href="../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Cruise%2520Control/index.html">cruise control</a> cancel switch is activated.
