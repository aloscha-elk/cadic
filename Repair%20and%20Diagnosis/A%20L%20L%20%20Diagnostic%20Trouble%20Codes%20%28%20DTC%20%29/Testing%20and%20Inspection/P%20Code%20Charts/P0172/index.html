Fuel delivery is controlled differently during Open Loop and Closed Loop (CL). During Open Loop, the ECM determines fuel delivery based on sensor signals without heated oxygen sensor (HO2S) input. During CL, the ECM adds HO2S inputs and level of purge to calculate the short and long term fuel trim (FT) adjustments. If the HO2S indicates a lean condition, the fuel trim values will be above <b>0 percent</b>. If the HO2S indicates a rich condition, the FT values will be below <b>0 percent</b>. The short term FT values change rapidly in response to the HO2S voltage signals. The long term FT makes coarse adjustments in order to maintain an optimum air/fuel ratio. A block of cells contain information arranged in combinations of engine RPM and engine load for a full range of vehicle operating conditions. The long term FT diagnostic is based on an average of cells currently being used. The ECM selects the cells based on the engine speed and load. The FT diagnostic will conduct a test to determine if a rich failure actually exists or if excessive vapor from the evaporative emission (EVAP) canister is causing a rich condition.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>For E85 compatible engines only-Over estimation of the ethanol content will result in a rich shift of fuel trim values, and under estimation will result in a lean shift of fuel trim values. A fuel trim DTC may set if the learned alcohol content, Fuel Alcohol Content parameter on the scan tool, is different than the measured alcohol content in the vehicle such that the fuel trim values exceed failure threshold values.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If the ECM detects an excessively lean condition, DTC P0171 or P0174 sets.
