In low speed, the fans are configured in series. In high speed, the fans are configured in parallel.<br><br>In low speed operation, the ECM applies ground to the coil side of the fan low relay. Voltage is applied directly to the left cooling fan through the switch side of the fan low relay, which is fed by the fan 1 fuse. The right fan is connected in series to the left fan through the de-energized fan control relay so that both operate at low speed.<br><br>In high speed operation, the ECM applies a ground to the coil side of the fan low relay, the fan control relay, and the fan high relay. Voltage is applied directly to the right cooling fan through the switch side of the relay, which is fed by the fan 2 fuse. The left cooling fan obtains voltage through the fan low relay and ground through the fan control relay.<br><br>The ECM monitors the low and high speed cooling fan relay control circuits for the following conditions:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Short to ground<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Short to voltage<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>An open circuit<br><br>If the ECM detects an improper voltage level on the low or high speed ECM driver circuits, then DTC P0480 or P0481 will set and the affected ECM driver will be disabled.<br><br><b>Conditions for Running the DTC</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The battery voltage is between <b>9-18 volts.</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine speed is <b>greater than 400 RPM.</b><br><br><b>Conditions for Setting the DTC</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The commanded state of the output driver module (ODM) and the actual state of the control circuit do not match.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The condition is present for <b>more than 5 seconds.</b><br><br><b>Action Taken When the DTC Sets</b><br><br>DTCs P0480 and P0481 are Type B DTCs.<br><br><b>Conditions for Clearing the MIL/DTC</b><br><br>DTCs P0480 and P0481 are Type B DTCs.<br><br><b>Diagnostic Aids</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>This test procedure requires that the vehicle battery has passed a load test and is completely charged.
