Certain conditions can cause multiple symptoms. These conditions are listed together under Symptoms Testing. Conditions that may only cause certain symptoms are listed separately under Additional Symptoms Test. Perform the Symptoms Testing before using the Additional Symptoms Tests. Poor Fuel Fill Quality test may be performed separately from the Symptoms Testing and Additional Symptoms Tests procedures.<br><br><b>DIAGNOSTIC FAULT INFORMATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Perform the Diagnostic System Check - Vehicle before using the symptoms procedures.  <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Initial%20Inspection%20and%20Diagnostic%20Overview/">Initial Inspection and Diagnostic Overview</a><br><br><b>SYMPTOMS DEFINITION</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Backfire</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Fuel ignites in the intake manifold or in the exhaust system, making a loud popping noise.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Cuts Out, Misses</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>A steady pulsation or jerking that follows engine speed, which is usually more pronounced as the engine load increases. This condition is not normally felt above <b>1500 RPM</b> or <b>48 km/h (30 mph)</b>. The exhaust has a steady spitting sound at idle or at low speed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Detonation/Spark Knock</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>A mild to severe ping which usually occurs worse while under acceleration. The engine makes sharp metallic knocks that change with throttle opening.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Dieseling, Run-On</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The engine continues to run after the key is turned OFF, but runs very rough.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Hard Start</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Engine cranks OK, but does not start for a long time. The vehicle does eventually run, or may start but immediately stalls.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Hesitation, Sag, Stumble</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Momentary lack of response as the accelerator is pushed down. This condition can occur at any vehicle speed. This condition is usually more pronounced when first trying to make the vehicle move, as from a stop. This condition may cause the engine to stall in severe conditions.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Lack of Power, Sluggishness, or Sponginess</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The engine delivers less than expected power. Little or no increase in speed when the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Accelerator%2520Pedal/index.html">accelerator pedal</a> is pushed down part way.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Poor Fuel Economy</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Fuel economy, as measured by an actual road test, is noticeably lower than expected. Also, the fuel economy is noticeably lower than it was on this vehicle at one time, as previously shown by an actual road test.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Poor Fuel Fill Quality</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Difficulty when refueling the vehicle.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Rough, Unstable, or Incorrect Idle and Stalling<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The engine runs unevenly at idle. If severe, the engine or the vehicle may shake. Engine idle may vary in speed. Either condition may be severe enough to stall the engine.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Surges/Chuggles</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Engine power variation under steady throttle or cruise. Feels like the vehicle speeds up and slows down with no change in the accelerator pedal position.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Symptoms Verification</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Before using the Symptom tables, perform the following inspections:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Ensure that the engine control module (ECM) and malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) are operating correctly.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Ensure that there are no diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) that are stored.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Ensure that the scan tool data is within a normal operating range.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Verify the customer concern.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Perform the Visual/Physical Inspection in this section. The visual/physical inspection is extremely important, and can lead to correcting a condition without additional testing. It may also help reveal the cause of an intermittent condition.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Identifying Intermittent Conditions</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Many intermittent conditions occur with harness or connector movement due to engine torque, rough pavement, vibration or physical movements of a component.
