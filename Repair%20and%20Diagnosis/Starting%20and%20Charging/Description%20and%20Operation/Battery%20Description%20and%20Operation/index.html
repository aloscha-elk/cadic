Therefore, to reduce the risk of personal injury when working near a battery:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Always shield your eyes and avoid leaning over the battery whenever possible.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not expose the battery to open flames or sparks.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not allow the battery electrolyte to contact the eyes or the skin. Flush immediately and thoroughly any contacted areas with water and get medical help.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Follow each step of the <a>jump starting</a> procedure in order.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Treat both the booster and the discharged batteries carefully when using the jumper cables.</b><br><br><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  Because of the materials used in the manufacture of automotive lead-acid batteries, dealers and service shops that handle them are subject to various regulations issued by OSHA, EPA, DOT, and various state or local agencies. Other regulations may also apply in other locations. Always know and follow these regulations when handling batteries.<br><br>Batteries that are no longer wanted must be disposed of by an approved battery recycler and must never be thrown in the trash or sent to a landfill.<br><br>Batteries that are not part of the vehicle itself, not the battery under the hood, must only be transported on public streets for business purposes via approved hazardous material transportation procedures.<br><br>Battery storage, charging, and testing facilities in repair shops must meet various requirements for ventilation, safety equipment, material segregation, etc.<br><br>The maintenance-free battery is standard. There are no vent plugs in the cover. The battery is completely sealed except for 2 small vent holes in the side. These vent holes allow the small amount of gas that is produced in the battery to escape.<br><br>The battery has 3 functions as a major source of energy:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine cranking<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Voltage stabilizer<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Alternate source of energy with generator overload<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/420423942.png"></div><br><br><br>The battery specification label, example, contains information about the following:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The test ratings<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The original equipment catalog number<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The recommended replacement model number<br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Battery Ratings</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>A battery may have 3 ratings:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Amp hour (AH)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Reserve capacity (RC)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Cold cranking amperage (CCA)<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When a battery is replaced, use a battery with similar ratings. Refer to the battery specification label on the original battery or refer to Battery Usage<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Amp Hour (AH)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The amp hour rating of a battery is the amount of time it takes a fully charged battery, being discharged at a constant rate of <b>1 amperes</b> and a constant temperature of <b>27&deg;C (80&deg;F)</b>, to reach a terminal voltage of <b>10.5 volts</b>.

The cold cranking amperage rating is the minimum amperage the battery must maintain for <b>30 seconds</b> at <b>-18&deg;C (0&deg;F)</b> while maintaining at least <b>7.2 volts</b>. Refer to Battery Usage for the cold cranking amperage rating for this vehicle.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Auxiliary Battery</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Auxiliary batteries are an available option on vehicles where many accessories can be utilized such as TVs, radios, lights, computers, etc. The charging of these batteries is explained in <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Starting%20and%20Charging/Charging%20System/">charging system</a> description and operation. Also, the auxiliary battery is only for accessory use and not part of the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Starting%20and%20Charging/Starting%20System/">starting system</a>.</div>
