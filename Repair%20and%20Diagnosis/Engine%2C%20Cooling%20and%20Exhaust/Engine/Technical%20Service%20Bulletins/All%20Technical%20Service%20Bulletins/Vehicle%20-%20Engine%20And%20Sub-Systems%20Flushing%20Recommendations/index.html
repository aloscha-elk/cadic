<h1>Vehicle - Engine And Sub-Systems Flushing Recommendations</h1><b>INFORMATION</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.: </b>04-06-01-029G<br><br><b>Date: </b>September 27, 2012<br><br><b>Subject:</b> Unscheduled Supplemental Services (Including Flushing Services and Additives) and Proper use of GM Simplified <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">Maintenance</a> Schedules (U.S. Only)<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2013 and Prior GM Passenger Cars and Trucks<br><br><b>Attention:</b><br>This bulletin is applicable to U.S. dealers only. Dealers in Canada refer to the latest version of Corporate Bulletin Number 12-06-01-008.<br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to update information. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 04-06-01-029F (Section 06 - Engine/Propulsion System).<br><br><b>Service is Important to You and Your Customer</b><br><br>General Motors takes great pride in offering our dealerships and customers high quality vehicles that require extremely low <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">maintenance</a> over the life of the vehicle. This low cost of ownership builds repeat sales and offers our customers measurable economy of operation against competing vehicles. <b>Our goal is to make the customer experience a key driver of why customers purchase GM products and services.</b> Providing responsible services at the proper intervals supports this goal and will help your dealership earn repeat business.<br><br><b>An Overview of Proper Vehicle Service</b><br><br>Today, many of your service departments merchandise supplemental services and <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/Fluids/">fluids</a> to customers indicating that these "flushes" have a positive effect on durability of the component part. It should be noted that analyses of returned parts that have been exposed to these aftermarket "flushes" show indications of potential damage and shortened durability.<br><br>The following information clearly defines the guidelines for servicing GM vehicles.<br><br><b>GM Authorized Service Information is Detailed, Descriptive and Complete</b><br><br>If GM determines that a specific model vehicle or powertrain needs supplemental service, GM will issue an Authorized Service Document with detailed service procedures that will identify any machine, tool or chemical required to conduct proper vehicle servicing. Listed below are a few examples of those messages as well as additional guidelines:<br><br><b>Engine Crankcase Flushing</b><br><br><b>General Motors Corporation does not endorse or recommend engine crankcase flushing for any of its gasoline engines.</b> Analysis of some of the aftermarket materials used for crankcase flushing indicate incompatibility with GM engine components and the potential for damage to some engine seals and bearings. Damage to engine components resulting from crankcase flushing <b>IS NOT COVERED</b> under the terms of the New Vehicle Warranty.<br><br><b>Subsystem Flushing</b><br><br>Flushing of air conditioning (A/C) lines, radiators, transmission coolers, and power steering systems are recognized practices to be performed after catastrophic failures or extreme corrosion when encountered in radiators. For acceptable A/C flushing concerns, refer to the Flushing procedure in Service Information (SI). This practice is <b>not</b> required or recommended for normal service operations.<br><br>The use of external transmission fluid exchange or flush machines is <b>not</b> recommended for the automatic or manual transmission. Use of external machines to replace the fluid may affect the operation or durability of the transmission. Transmission fluid should only be replaced by draining and refilling following procedures in Service Information (SI). Refer to Automatic/Manual Transmission Fluid and Filter Replacement.<br><br><b>Approved Transmission Flushing Tool (Transmission Cooler Only)</b><br><br>The Automatic Transmission Oil Cooler Flow Check and Flush Tool <b>IS</b> recommended for GM vehicles. Refer to Transmission Fluid Cooler Flow Check and Flush in the Service Information website using the J-45096.<br><br><b>Our Commitment to providing Quality Service to Our Customers</b><br><br>Customers will appreciate and trust dealerships that inform and offer them what they truly need for continued trouble-free operation of their GM vehicle. Examine your service department's practices and verify that all Service Advisors and Technicians focus on providing a truly exceptional service experience through vehicle inspections and offering appropriate products at time of service. Use this opportunity to leverage recent technology including the Service Workbench Menu and Inspection Tool Kit and review the services you provide to your customers. Here are a few suggestions:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Review your processes to ensure that your service team performs a Multi-Point Vehicle Inspection on every vehicle visiting your service lane. Use the electronic Multi-Point Vehicle Inspection process in the Service Workbench to document vehicle needs and evaluate them for safety and wear items. This information can be quickly integrated into your marketing efforts and the Customer Sales and Service Retention (CSSR) program to personalize the message to your customers.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Take the time required to align your dealership service practices with the GM Simplified <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">Maintenance</a> Schedule and use the Service Workbench Menu tool to ensure consistent pricing for each customer.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Maintain your service expertise through GM Training and ASE Certification of your technicians.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Finally, take advantage of the Certified Service initiatives that continue drive service customers to your dealership.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br></div>
