<h1>Diagnostic Procedure Instructions</h1><br><br><b>DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURE INSTRUCTIONS</b><br><br>The following is an overview of instructions for all 16 categories which may be included in a diagnostic procedure.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Diagnostic Instructions</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>A link to the Diagnostic System Check - Vehicle is provided here. This procedure should be performed prior to performing other diagnostic procedures, as this prevents misdiagnosis where there are integrated system dependencies.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>A link to the Strategy Based Diagnosis is provided here. This provides an overview on how a technician should diagnose a vehicle.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>A link to the Diagnostic Procedure Instructions is provided here. This information is an overview of instructions for all 16 categories which may be included in a diagnostic procedure.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>DTC Descriptor</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Describes what DTCs are diagnosed in this procedure. The DTC number, with Symptom Description when applicable, and descriptor are written out.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Diagnostic Fault Information</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The diagnostic Fault Information table identifies each circuit that makes up an electrical subsystem and the associated circuit faults. DTCs and symptoms are listed in the table for all circuit fault modes. This information can be used to diagnose an electrical fault, or as a quick visual aid showing how the different symptoms and DTCs apply for the subsystem being diagnosed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Even though all the DTCs and symptoms are shown in this table it does not mean they will all be diagnosed in the same procedure.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/619946298.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>An example table from an engine coolant temperature (ECT) procedure:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Typical Scan Tool Data</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The Typical Scan Tool Data table identifies a scan tool data parameter and its value in reference to potential circuit faults.<br><br><h3>ECT Sensor Temperature - PCM:</h3><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/619948259.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>An example table from an ECT procedure:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Circuit/System Description</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Circuit/System Description identifies how a circuit/system normally functions.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Conditions For Running The DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Conditions for running the DTC, identifies what conditions must be present to allow the diagnostic to run.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Conditions For Setting The DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Conditions for Setting the DTC, identifies the condition(s) that must be present in order to fail the diagnostic and when to set the DTC.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Action Taken When The DTC Sets</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Actions Taken When the DTC sets, identifies the default actions taken when a <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Transmission%2520Control%2520Systems/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Transfer%2520Case/Control%2520Module/index.html">control module</a> sets a DTC.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Conditions For Clearing The DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Conditions for Clearing the DTC, identifies the conditions that must be met in order to clear the DTC.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Diagnostic Aids</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Diagnostic Aids are suggestions which explain other methods to diagnose the condition. It also provides unique information about the system used to assist the technician in finding and repairing a vehicle condition.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Circuit/System Verification</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The diagnostic format does not force a technician to any of the 3 diagnostic categories (Circuit/System Verification, Circuit/System Testing and Component Testing). However, performing the Circuit/System Verification category first, aids in determining if a vehicle condition is current. This category also serves to route the technician to another diagnostic procedure which should be performed first; for example, a DTC with a higher priority.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Circuit/System Verification is a non-intrusive procedure outlining how to verify that a system or a portion of a system is functioning correctly. During the verification process, the vehicle is kept intact and tested as a complete system. This verification is used to assist the technician in determining whether a condition is current or intermittent. When a condition is determined to be intermittent, a technician can use the link in Electrical Information Reference: Testing for Intermittent Conditions and Poor Connections.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The technician should be able to identify if the fault is occurring on the input circuit - signal or on the output circuit - control when applicable. The technician will need to decide from the verification results if the system is working correctly or if further diagnosis needs to be performed in either Circuit/System Testing and/or Component Testing.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Circuit/System Testing</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The diagnostic format does not force a technician to any of the 3 diagnostic categories (Circuit/System Verification, Circuit/System Testing and Component Testing). However, beginning with the Circuit/System Verification category aids in determining if a vehicle condition is current.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Circuit/System Testing is a step by step, positive-flow, testing sequence which allows the technician to perform each test step, in sequence, until a fault is detected. If the result of a test step is achieved, the normal flow is to proceed to the next step. If the result is NOT achieved, the repair arrow bullet will identify what actions need to take place.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Intrusive diagnostics are performed to locate the system fault. System harness connections are disconnected from the module or component to test individual circuit functions. The module or component will be used to assist in verifying the circuit function. When a test does not pass, the repair steps will indicate what circuit faults to test. For example, short to voltage, short to ground or open/high resistance.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When testing for individual circuit faults, the technician is expected to include terminal inspections such as connection surfaces and terminal tension at both the harness and component/module. Additionally, a technician can use the links in Electrical Information Reference: Testing for Intermittent Conditions and Poor Connections or Circuit Testing.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Transmission%2520Control%2520Systems/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Transfer%2520Case/Control%2520Module/index.html">control modules</a> and components will also be diagnosed during these test steps. A retest of a control module or component should always be performed before replacement. For example, re-connect all components and modules and retest the system to verify the condition still exists before replacing modules or components.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Component Testing</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The diagnostic format does not force a technician to any of the 3 diagnostic categories (Circuit/System Verification, Circuit/System Testing and Component Testing). However, beginning with the Circuit/System Verification category aids in determining if a vehicle condition is current.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Component Testing can offer static and/or dynamic component tests. These tests can be used to verify if a component is operating correctly to avoid unnecessary replacement.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Testing modules in this category will not be offered. In most cases, the module is used to verify the harness circuits in the Circuit/System Testing category and a retest of the module should always be performed before replacement.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Repair Instructions</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Repair Instructions provides a link to Diagnostic Repair Verification. This link describes how to verify the vehicle is repaired.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>All links to Repair or Replacement procedures are located here.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Repair Verification</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Repair Verification describes how to verify the vehicle is repaired when additional instructions are needed beyond what is in Diagnostic Repair Verification.</div>
