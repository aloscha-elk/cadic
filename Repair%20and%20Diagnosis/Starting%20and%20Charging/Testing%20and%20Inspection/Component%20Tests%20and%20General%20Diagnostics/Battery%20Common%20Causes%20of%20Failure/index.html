<h1>Battery Common Causes of Failure</h1><br><br><b>BATTERY COMMON CAUSES OF FAILURE</b><br><br>A battery is not designed to last forever. With proper care, however, the battery will provide years of good service. If the battery tests good but still fails to perform well, the following are some of the more common causes:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A vehicle accessory was left on overnight.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The driving speeds have been slow with frequent stops with many electrical accessories in use, particularly air conditioning, headlights, wipers, heated rear window, cellular telephone, etc.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The electrical load has exceeded the generator output, particularly with the addition of aftermarket equipment.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Existing conditions in the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Starting%20and%20Charging/Charging%20System/">charging system</a>, including the following possibilities:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>A slipping belt<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>A bad generator<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The battery has not been properly maintained, including a loose battery hold down or missing battery insulator if used.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>There are mechanical conditions in the electrical system, such as a short or a pinched wire, attributing to power failure. Refer to General Electrical Diagnosis.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Electrolyte Freezing</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The freezing point of electrolyte depends on its specific gravity. A fully charged battery will not freeze until the ambient temperature gets below <b>-54&deg;C (-65&deg;F)</b>. However, a battery with a low state of charge may freeze at temperatures as high as <b>-7&deg;C (+20&deg;F)</b>. Since freezing may ruin a battery, the battery should be protected against freezing by keeping it properly charged. As long as the green eye is visible in the hydrometer, the freezing point of the battery will be somewhere below <b>-32&deg;C (-25&deg;F)</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Battery Protection During Vehicle Storage</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Certain devices on the vehicle maintain a small continuous current drain on the battery. A battery that is not used for an extended period of time will discharge. Eventually permanent damage will result. Discharged batteries will also freeze in cold weather. Refer to Battery Inspection/Test.  <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Starting%2520and%2520Charging/Testing%2520and%2520Inspection/Component%2520Tests%2520and%2520General%2520Diagnostics/Battery%2520Inspection%252FTest/index.html">Battery Inspection/Test</a><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>In order to maintain a battery state of charge while storing the vehicle for more than <b>30 days</b>, disconnect the battery ground to protect the battery from discharge by parasitic current drains.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the battery cannot be disconnected:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Maintain a high state of charge.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Establish a regular schedule for recharging the battery every <b>20-45 days</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>A battery that has remained in a discharged state for a long period of time is difficult to recharge or may be permanently damaged.</div>
