<h1>Rear Suspension Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>General Description</b><br><br>All 15 series utility vehicles use a 5-link rear <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> system. The rear axle is attached to the frame with the upper <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Suspension/Control%2520Arm/index.html">control arms</a>, lower control arms, and a track bar. Two coil springs and a link mounted rear stabilizer shaft complete the system. <br><br>All 25 series Utility models use a rear spring <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> system and a solid rear axle suspension system. The rear axle is attached to the multi-rear springs by U-bolts. The front of the spring ends are attached to the frame at the front hangers through rubber bushings. The rear of the spring ends are attached to the frame with shackles that allow the springs to change their length, due to the spring compressing, while the vehicle is in motion. The ride control is provided by 2 identical direct dual-action shock absorbers that are angle-mounted between the frame and the brackets which are attached to the axle tubes.<br></div>
