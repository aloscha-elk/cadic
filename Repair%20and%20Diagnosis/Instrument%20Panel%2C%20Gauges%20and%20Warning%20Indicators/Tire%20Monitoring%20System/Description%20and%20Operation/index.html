<h1>Tire Monitoring System: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>Tire Pressure Monitor Description and Operation</b><br><br>The tire pressure monitor (TPM) system warns the driver when a significant loss of tire pressure occurs in any of the 4 <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a>, and allows the driver to display the individual tire pressures, and their locations on the driver information center (DIC).<br><br>The system uses the powertrain control module (PCM), instrument panel cluster (IPC), DIC, remote control door lock receiver (RCDLR) a radio frequency (RF) transmitting pressure sensor in each wheel/tire assembly, and the serial data circuit to preform the system functions. <br><br>When the vehicle is stationary the sensor's internal accelerometer is inactive, which puts the sensors into a stationary state. In this state the sensors sample tire pressure once every <b>30 seconds</b> and do not transmit at all if the tire pressures do not change. As vehicle speed increases, centrifugal force activates the sensor's internal accelerometer causing the sensors to go into rolling mode. In this mode the sensors sample pressure once every <b>30 second</b> and transmit in rolling mode once every <b>60 seconds.</b> The RCDLR receives and translates the data contained in each sensor's RF transmission into sensor presence, sensor mode, and tire pressure. The RCDLR sends the tire pressure and tire location data to the DIC via the serial data circuit where they are displayed as follows:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>LF TIRE XX PSI<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>RF TIRE XX PSI<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>RR TIRE XX PSI<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>LR TIRE XX PSI<br><br>The sensors continuously compare their last transmitted pressure to their current pressure sample and will transmit in re-measure mode if a <b>8 kPa (1.2 psi)</b> change in tire pressure has been detected in either a stationary, or rolling state. When the TPM system detects a significant loss of tire pressure, the CHECK TIRE PRESSURE message is displayed on the DIC and the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tire%2520Monitoring%2520System/Low%2520Tire%2520Pressure%2520Indicator/index.html">low tire pressure indicator</a> is displayed on the IPC. Both the message and indicator can be cleared by adjusting the tire pressures to the recommended kPa/psi. The sensor's pressure range is <b>0-102 psi.</b> The sensors pressure accuracy from--<b>10 to +70 degrees C is &plusmn; 13.7 kPa (2 psi).</b> Refer to Vehicle Certification, Tire Place Card, Anti-Theft, and Service Parts ID Label. <br><br>The RCDLR has the ability to detect malfunctions within the TPM system. Any malfunction detected will cause the DIC to display the SERVICE TIRE MONITOR message. For more information on other functions of the RCDLR, refer to Keyless Entry System description and Operation. <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Keyless Entry System Description and Operation<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Power Door Locks Description and Operation<br><br></div>
