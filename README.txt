Instructions for using car manuals downloaded from Operation Charm:

1. Extract the entire .zip file. Usually "extract all" button will do this.
   You cannot open individual files, the images will not work. Must extract the whole zip first.
2. Open the folder you extracted to.
3. Double-click "index.html" in the folder! If this does not work, open your browser,
   then press Ctrl+O, then find index.html in the file manager.

Known BUG: If you downloaded the ".zip with better file names", then the links may not work on Windows, because Windows has idiotic maximum length restrict on file names.
