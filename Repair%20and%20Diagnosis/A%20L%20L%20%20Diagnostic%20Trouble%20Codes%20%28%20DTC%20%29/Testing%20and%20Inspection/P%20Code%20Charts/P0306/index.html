By monitoring variations in the crankshaft rotation speed for each cylinder, the ECM is able to detect individual misfire events. If the ECM detects a misfire rate sufficient to cause emission levels to exceed mandated standards, DTC P0300 sets. Under certain driving conditions, a misfire rate can be high enough to cause the catalytic converter to overheat, possibly damaging the converter. The malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) will flash ON and OFF when catalytic converter overheating conditions are present and DTC P0300 is set. DTCs P0301-P0308 corresponds to cylinders 1-8. If the ECM is able to determine that a specific cylinder is misfiring, the DTC for that cylinder will also set.<br><br><b>CONDITIONS FOR RUNNING THE DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTC P0010, P0011, P0101, P0102, P0103, P0106, P0108, P0116, P0117, P0118, P0128, P0220, P0335, P0336, P0502, P1258, P3401, P3425, P3441, and P3449 are not set.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine speed is between <b>650-6,200 RPM</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition voltage is between <b>11-18 volts</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine coolant temperature (ECT) is between <b>-7 and +130&deg;C (+19 and +266&deg;F)</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The fuel level is more than <b>10 percent</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The antilock brake system (ABS) and the traction control system (TCS) are not active.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The power management is not active.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The transmission is not changing gears.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ECM is not in fuel shut-off, or decel fuel cut-off mode.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Excessive drive wheel slip is not detected.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Power Take Off is disabled.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Cylinder Deactivation is not in progress.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A manual transmission with a throttle position less than <b>95 percent</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTC P0300-P0308 runs continuously when the above conditions are met.<br><br><b>CONDITIONS FOR SETTING THE DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The ECM is detecting a crankshaft rotation speed variation indicating a misfire sufficient to cause emission levels to exceed mandated standards.<br><br><b>ACTION TAKEN WHEN THE DTC SETS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTCs P0300-P0308 are type B DTCs.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the MIL is flashing the fuel injector may be disabled for the misfiring cylinder to protect the catalytic converter.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Depending on the conditions that set the DTC the engine may go into open loop.<br><br><b>CONDITIONS FOR CLEARING THE MIL/DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTCs P0300-P0308 are type B DTCs.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The DTC must pass under the same operating conditions that were present when the DTC failed.<br><br><b>DIAGNOSTIC AIDS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A misfire may only occur when the engine is operating under a load or when the engine is cold.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A high resistance condition on any ignition control (IC) circuit can cause an engine misfire P0300-P0308 DTC to set, without setting an IC circuit P0351-P0358 DTC.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>This test procedure requires that the vehicle battery has passed a load test and is completely charged.
