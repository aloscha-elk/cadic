The heater is supplied with high current power and ground circuits that are used to energize the heater coils. The low current logic voltage is supplied to the heater through the RUN relay in the underhood fuse block. The RUN relay is a PCB relay energized by the BCM only while the engine is running. The heated washer cycle operation is activated by a separate switch located on the instrument panel accessory switch assembly. When the heated washer fluid switch is pressed the heated washer switch signal circuit is momentarily grounded and the heated washer cycle is activated. During the heated wash cycle the 3 heater elements in the solvent heater are energized, and when the solvent temperature reaches approximately <b>70&deg;C (160&deg;F)</b> the heater grounds the washer switch signal circuit until the heated solvent is dispensed. The heated washer cycle will run 4 heat and wash actions unless deactivated by the heated washer switch signal.<br><br><b>DIAGNOSTIC AIDS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Verify that the standard windshield wiper washer system operates normally before attempting to diagnose a heated washer system concern.<br><br><b>CIRCUIT/SYSTEM TESTING</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Windshield Washer Solvent Heater Malfunction</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition OFF, disconnect the C1 harness connector at the windshield washer solvent heater assembly.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition ON, verify that a test lamp illuminates between the battery positive voltage circuit terminal 1 and ground.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the test lamp does not illuminate, test the battery positive voltage circuit for a short to ground or an open/high resistance.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that a test illuminates between the washer solvent heater assembly ground circuit terminal 2 and battery voltage.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the test lamp does not illuminate, test the ground circuit for an open/high resistance.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition OFF, disconnect the C2 harness connector at the windshield washer solvent heater assembly.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine running, verify that a test lamp illuminates between the ignition 3 voltage circuit terminal 6 and ground.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the test lamp does not illuminate, test the ignition 3 voltage circuit for a short to ground or an open/high resistance.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that a test illuminates between the washer solvent heater assembly ground circuit terminal 4 and battery voltage.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the test lamp does not illuminate, test the ground circuit for an open/high resistance.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that a test lamp does not illuminate between the washer fluid heated control switch signal circuit terminal 1 and battery voltage.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the test lamp is illuminated, test the signal circuit for a short to ground.
