<h1>Restraints - Passenger Presence System Information</h1><b>INFORMATION</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.: </b>06-08-50-009G<br><br><b>Date: </b>February 03, 2012<br><br><b>Subject: </b>Information on Passenger Presence Sensing System (PPS or PSS) Concerns with Custom Upholstery, Accessory Seat Heaters or Other Comfort Enhancing Devices<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2013 and Prior GM Passenger Cars and Trucks<br>Equipped with Passenger Presence Sensing System<br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to add model years. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 06-08-50-009F (Section 08 - Body and Accessories).<br><br><b>Concerns About Safety and Alterations to the Front Passenger Seat</b><br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>ON A GM VEHICLE EQUIPPED WITH A PASSENGER SENSING SYSTEM, USE THE SEAT COVERS AND OTHER SEAT-RELATED EQUIPMENT AS RELEASED BY GM FOR THAT VEHICLE. DO NOT ALTER THE SEAT COVERS OR SEAT-RELATED EQUIPMENT. ANY ALTERATIONS TO SEAT COVERS OR GM ACCESSORIES DEFEATS THE INTENDED DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM. GM WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY PROBLEMS CAUSED BY USE OF SUCH IMPROPER SEAT ALTERATIONS, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY REPAIRS INCURRED.</b><br><br>The front passenger seat in many GM vehicles is equipped with a passenger sensing system that will turn off the right front passenger's frontal airbag under certain conditions, such as when an infant or child seat is present. In some vehicles, the passenger sensing system will also turn off the right front passenger's seat mounted side impact airbag. For the system to function properly, sensors are used in the seat to detect the presence of a properly-seated occupant. The passenger sensing system may not operate properly if the original seat trim is replaced (1) by non-GM covers, upholstery or trim, or (2) by GM covers, upholstery or trim designed for a different vehicle or (3) by GM covers, upholstery or trim that has been altered by a trim shop, or (4) if any object, such as an aftermarket seat heater or a comfort enhancing pad or device is installed under the seat fabric or between the occupant and the seat fabric.<br><br><b>Aftermarket Seat Heaters, Custom Upholstery, and Comfort Enhancing Pads or Devices</b><br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>ON A GM VEHICLE EQUIPPED WITH A PASSENGER SENSING SYSTEM, USE ONLY SEAT COVERS AND OTHER SEAT-RELATED EQUIPMENT RELEASED AS GM ACCESSORIES FOR THAT VEHICLE. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER TYPE OF SEAT COVERS OR SEAT-RELATED EQUIPMENT, OR GM ACCESSORIES RELEASED FOR OTHER VEHICLE APPLICATIONS. GM WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY PROBLEMS CAUSED BY USE OF SUCH IMPROPER SEAT ACCESSORIES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY REPAIRS MADE NECESSARY BY SUCH USE.</b><br><br>Many types of aftermarket accessories are available to customers, upfitting shops, and dealers. Some of these devices sit on top of, or are Velcro(R) strapped to the seat while others such as seat heaters are installed under the seat fabric. Additionally, seat covers made of leather or other materials may have different padding thickness installed that could prevent the Passenger Sensing System from functioning properly. Never alter the vehicle seats. Never add pads or other devices to the seat cushion, as this may interfere with the operation of the Passenger Sensing System and either prevent proper deployment of the passenger airbag or prevent proper suppression of the passenger air bag.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br></div>
