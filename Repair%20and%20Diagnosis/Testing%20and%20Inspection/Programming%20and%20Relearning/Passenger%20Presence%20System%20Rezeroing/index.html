<h1>Passenger Presence System Rezeroing</h1><br><br><b>PASSENGER PRESENCE SYSTEM REZEROING</b><br><br><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The Inflatable Restraints Passenger Presence System (PPS) is a calibrated system that requires rezeroing anytime the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Seats/Seat%2520Cushion/index.html">seat cushion</a> trim attachments have been removed or the PPS has been replaced. The procedures below are designed to assist in the rezeroing of the PPS. Before you start, read these procedures carefully and completely. For further information regarding the PPS refer to SIR System Description and Operation.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  The following procedures must be followed:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Read this procedure carefully and completely.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The PPS will not function properly if the PPS rezeroing procedure is not performed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Perform the Diagnostic System Check - Vehicle after successfully completing the rezeroing procedure to ensure the system is functioning properly.<br><br><b>PASSENGER PRESENCE SYSTEM (PPS) REZEROING PROCEDURE</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  Before rezeroing the PPS, the front passenger seat must be completely empty of all items. The presence of any items on the front passenger seat will affect the calibration and operation of the PPS.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Empty the front outboard passenger seat.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that all SIR and PPS components, connectors, and connector position assurances (CPAs) are properly connected and mounted.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Install a scan tool.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn ON the ignition, with the engine OFF.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  DTC B0081 4B may be set prior to rezeroing the system if the system was replaced with a service kit. All other SIR and PPS DTCs must be cleared before rezeroing the PPS. The presence of current or history DTCs will prevent the PPS from rezeroing and may set additional DTCs.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use the scan tool in order to clear the SIR and PPS DTCs.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>With a scan tool, request the PPS rezeroing procedure.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Initiate the PPS rezeroing procedure. The PPS will illuminate both PASSENGER AIR BAG ON and OFF indicators until the rezeroing procedure has been completed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the rezeroing procedure has been successfully completed, the PPS will display the current system status.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the rezeroing procedure was unsuccessful, repeat this procedure. Due to the communication status between the SDM and the PPS module, this procedure may have to be repeated until a successful rezero attempt has been achieved.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>10.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After the PPS has been successfully rezeroed, perform the Diagnostic System Check - Vehicle.  <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Initial%20Inspection%20and%20Diagnostic%20Overview/">Initial Inspection and Diagnostic Overview</a></div>
