<h1>Air Bag Control Module: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>INFLATABLE RESTRAINT SENSING AND DIAGNOSTIC MODULE (SDM)</b><br><br>The sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) is a microprocessor and the control center for the Supplemental Inflatable Restraint (SIR) System. The SDM contains internal sensors along with several external sensors, if equipped, mounted at various locations on the vehicle. In the event of a collision, the SDM performs calculations using the signals received from the internal and external sensors. The SDM compares the results of the calculations to values stored in memory. When these calculations exceed the stored value, the SDM will cause current to flow through the appropriate deployment loops to deploy the air bags. The SDM records the SIR System status when a deployment occurs and requests the instrument panel cluster (IPC) to turn the AIR BAG indicator ON. The SDM performs continuous diagnostic monitoring of the SIR System electrical components and circuitry when the ignition is turned ON. If the SDM detects a malfunction, a DTC will be stored and the SDM will request the IPC to turn the AIR BAG indicator ON. In the event that battery voltage is lost during a collision, the SDM maintains a <b>23-volt</b> loop reserve (23 VLR) for deployment of the air bags. It is important to note, when disabling the SIR System for servicing or rescue operations to allow the 23 VLR to dissipate, which could take up to <b>1 minute</b>.</div>
