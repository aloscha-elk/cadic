The scan tool will display a higher value with a longer pulse width, or a lower value with a shorter pulse width.<br><br><b>Knock Retard:</b>  The scan tool displays in ï¿½. This parameter indicates the amount of timing retard commanded by the control module. The scan tool will display a lower value if no knock is detected, and a higher value as more knock is detected and the control module retards the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Tune-up%20and%20Engine%20Performance%20Checks/Ignition%20Timing/">ignition timing</a>.<br><br><b><a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Ignition%2520System/Knock%2520Sensor/index.html">KS</a> Active Counter:</b>  This parameter displays the number of times the control module detects activity from the knock sensor.<br><br><b><a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Ignition%2520System/Knock%2520Sensor/index.html">KS</a> Bank 1 Circuit Status:</b>  This parameter displays the diagnostic state of the output driver for the knock sensor circuit. The scan tool displays OK, Fault, or Incomplete. The scan tool will display OK if the circuit is operating correctly.
