Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 08-03-08-003 (Section 03 - Suspension).<br><br>General Motors Vehicle Engineering has introduced a new design Gen III front <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Drive%2520Axles%252C%2520Bearings%2520and%2520Joints/Wheel%2520Hub/index.html">wheel hub</a> for the above listed vehicles that replaces the Gen II product.<br><br>These Gen II 4x2 and 4x4 applications that were previously serviced by seven part numbers are now serviced by three Gen III part numbers. <br><br>Concerns have been expressed by technicians regarding the use of the new supersessions and whether the Gen III hubs will properly fit the vehicles being serviced, especially because of visual and functional differences (splines). This bulletin has been developed to address those concerns.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/121764820.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Please refer to the table above for information on the Gen III replacement part for each Gen II application. At the end of the bulletin you will find an illustrated "Hub Gallery" with graphic depictions of both Gen II and replacement style Gen III parts. Using these illustrations you should be able to identify both the Gen II and Gen III <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Drive%2520Axles%252C%2520Bearings%2520and%2520Joints/Wheel%2520Hub/index.html">wheel hubs</a>.<br><br><b>Warning</b><br>If replacing wheel studs, please refer to the GM Parts Catalog for the correct stud part number for each application. Different types of studs are used depending on the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Drive%2520Axles%252C%2520Bearings%2520and%2520Joints/Wheel%2520Hub/index.html">wheel hub</a> application.<br><br>When replacing an older Gen II design 4x2 hub with a new 4x2/4x4 common Gen III hub, it is acceptable to have a bearing with splines on it for a 4x2 application that previously did not. However, the older Gen II design 4x4 hubs should NOT be used on a 4x2 vehicle. The Gen II 4x4 hub relies on the tension of the wheel drive shaft joint to hold everything together. The roll form feature on the inboard side of the new 4x2/4x4 Gen III hub eliminates this concern.<br><br>The only hub that is not back serviceable is P/N 15719007 (not pictured) for 1999-2000 C25 applications due to a different hub flange to bearing flange offset.<br><br><b>Important:</b><br>Only the new part numbers referenced in this bulletin are interchangeable between the 4x2 and 4x4 applications with the exception of P/N 15719007 (Not Shown). Under no circumstances should any other 4x4 hub be used in a 4x2 application.<br><br>Illustrated Hub Gallery<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/121958453.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/122104817.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/122362768.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/122612821.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>The <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Drive%2520Axles%252C%2520Bearings%2520and%2520Joints/Wheel%2520Hub/index.html">wheel hubs</a> illustrated above are intended to provide enough visual details to identify subtle differences between the Gen II and Gen III replacement hubs.
