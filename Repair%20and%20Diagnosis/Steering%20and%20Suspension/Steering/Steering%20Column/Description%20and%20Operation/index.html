The energy-absorbing feature, collapsible <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Steering/Steering%2520Shaft/index.html">steering shaft</a>, and break away mounting features help reduce the injury in the event of an accident. In addition to these features, the following driver safety features may be on the steering column. To inspect the steering column for damage, refer to Steering Column Accident Damage Inspection.<br><br>Electronic Park Lock (EPL)/Ignition Lock Cylinder Control Actuator<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If the vehicle is equipped with automatic transmission and a floor mounted console gear shift, it has an ignition lock cylinder control actuator system in the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/Steering%20Column/">steering column</a>. The ignition lock cylinder control actuator purpose is to prevent the ignition key from being turned to the OFF position when the transmission is in any position other than PARK and the vehicle may still be moving. The column ignition lock system consists of an ignition lock cylinder control actuator, and a park position switch that is located in the automatic transmission shift lock control switch. The ignition lock cylinder control actuator contains a pin that is spring loaded to mechanically prevent the ignition key cylinder from being turned to the lock position when the vehicle transmission is not in the PARK position. If vehicle power is lost, and/or the transmission is not in the PARK position the operator will not be able to turn the ignition key to the lock position and will not be able to remove the ignition key from the column. <br><br>Linear Shift Assembly<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If the vehicle is equipped with a column mounted gear shift, it has a linear shift assembly on the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/Steering%20Column/">steering column</a>. The linear shift assembly has a cable that runs from the linear shift assembly to the ignition lock cylinder case. The purpose of this cable is to prevent the ignition key from being turned to the OFF position when the transmission is in gear and the vehicle may still be moving. The linear shift assembly cable contains a pin that is spring loaded to mechanically prevent the ignition key cylinder from being turned to the lock position when the vehicle transmission is not in the PARK position. If vehicle power is lost, and/or the transmission is not in the PARK position the operator will not be able to turn the ignition key to the lock position and will not be able to remove the ignition key from the column.<br><br>SIR Coil and Module<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>For additional information on the operation of the SIR coil and module, refer to SIR System Description and Operation.<br><br>Automatic Transmission Shift Lock Actuator <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The automatic transmission shift lock control system is a safety device that prevents an inadvertent shift out of PARK when the engine is running. The driver must press the brake pedal before moving the shift lever out of the PARK position. The system consists of the following components: ^ The automatic transmission shift lock control solenoid ^ The automatic transmission shift lock control switch ^ The body control module (BCM) ^ The powertrain control module (PCM)/engine control module (ECM) With the ignition in the ON position, voltage is supplied to automatic transmission shift lock control switch. Voltage flows through the normally closed contacts of the automatic transmission shift lock control switch to the automatic transmission shift lock control solenoid. When the BCM receives a class 2 message from the PCM/ECM indicating the transmission is in the park position the BCM then grounds the automatic transmission shift lock solenoid control circuit. This energizes the automatic transmission shift lock control solenoid causing the transmission shift lever to be physically locked in the PARK position. When the brake pedal is pressed the contacts in the automatic transmission shift lock control switch open, de-energizing the automatic transmission shift lock control solenoid. This allows the shift lever to be move out of the PARK position. <br><br><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/Steering%20Wheel/">Steering Wheel</a> Angle Sensor or Steering Wheel Position Sensor <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The steering wheel position sensor is located somewhere along the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Steering/Steering%2520Shaft/index.html">steering shaft</a> assembly. The sensor measures the position of the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Steering/Steering%20Wheel/">steering wheel</a> and the speed at which it is rotated. A signal representing this measurement is provided to the vehicle stability enhancement system (VSES) module. The VSES module uses this signal, along with several others representing different vehicle conditions, to monitor the driving behavior of the vehicle and ensure that it stays in control. If the VSES module determines that the vehicle is out of control it provides signals to the powertrain control module (PCM) and the ABS module. These output signals are used to modulate the transmission torque and brake pressure of each of the vehicles <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> in order to regain control of the vehicle.<br><br></div>
