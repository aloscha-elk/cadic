<h1>Restraints - Driver/Passenger Seat Head Rest Information</h1><b>INFORMATION</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.: </b>10-08-50-003B<br><br><b>Date: </b>November 10, 2011<br><br><b>Subject: </b>Information on Driver or Passenger Seat Head Restraint Concerns with Comfort, Custom Upholstery or Other Comfort Enhancing Devices<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2012 and Prior GM Passenger Cars and Trucks<br>Equipped with Adjustable Head Restraints<br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to add information. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 10-08-50-003A (Section 08 - Body and Accessories).<br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>ON A GM VEHICLE EQUIPPED WITH ADJUSTABLE HEAD RESTRAINTS, USE THE HEAD RESTRAINT COVERS, FOAM AND OTHER SEAT-RELATED EQUIPMENT AS RELEASED BY GM FOR THAT VEHICLE. DO NOT ALTER OR REPOSITION THE <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Restraints%20and%20Safety%20Systems/Head%20Restraint%20System/">HEAD RESTRAINT SYSTEM</a>. ANY ALTERATIONS TO HEAD RESTRAINTS DEFEATS THE INTENDED DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM. GM WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY PROBLEMS CAUSED BY USE OF SUCH IMPROPER DESIGN ALTERATIONS, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY REPAIRS INCURRED.</b><br><br>You may have a customer with a concern that the head restraint is uncomfortable or sits too far forward. The front driver and passenger seats are equipped with head restraints that have been designed to help minimize injuries while still providing comfort to the occupants. Each GM vehicle has its own specifically designed head restraint.<br><br>The following are some options that may be helpful for the customer to balance their overall seat comfort while seats are in use:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Adjust the head restraint so that the top of the restraint is at the same height as the top of the occupants head.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Try angling the seat back and move the seat a little forward to make the headrest angle less severe.<br><br>The head restraints should only be used in the vehicle for which they were designed. The head restraint will not operate to its design intent if the original foam is replaced (1) by non-GM foam or head restraint, (2) by GM foam or head restraint designed for a different vehicle, (3) by GM foam or head restraint that has been altered by a trim shop or (4) if any object, such as an aftermarket comfort enhancing pad or device, is installed.<br><br>Never modify the design of the head restraint or remove the head restraint from the vehicle as this may interfere with the operation of the seating and restraint systems and may prevent proper positioning of the passenger within the vehicle.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br></div>
