<h1>Keyless System - Remote Start Transmitter Diagnostic Tip</h1><b>INFORMATION</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.: </b>09-08-52-004A<br><br><b>Date: </b>January 08, 2010<br><br><b>Subject: </b>Diagnostic Tips/Recommendations on GM Accessory 2-Way Remote Start Transmitter When Transmitter Battery is Weak or Dead<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2007-2010 Buick Lucerne<br>2008-2010 Buick Enclave<br>2007-2010 Cadillac DTS, Escalade, Escalade ESV, Escalade EXT<br>2007-2009 Chevrolet Equinox<br>2007-2010 Chevrolet Avalanche, Cobalt, HHR, Impala, Silverado, Tahoe<br>2009-2010 Chevrolet Malibu, Traverse<br>2007-2010 GMC Acadia, Sierra, Yukon<br>2007-2009 Pontiac G5, G6, Solstice, Torrent<br>2008-2009 Pontiac G8<br>2007-2010 Saturn AURA, OUTLOOK, SKY, VUE<br>2007-2010 HUMMER H2<br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to update the models and model years. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 09-08-52-004 (Section 08 - Body and Accessories).<br><br>Follow these procedures if a customer comments that their GM Accessory 2-way transmitter stopped communicating with the vehicle. <br><br><b>About GM Accessory 2-Way Remote Start</b><br><br>The GM Accessory 2-way transmitter has the ability to operate a second vehicle equipped with a 2-way advanced remote start system, but often the 2-way transmitter may only be coded to one vehicle. If the customer presses the left side button twice within one second, the 2-way transmitter will enter second vehicle mode and will not control the original vehicle until a subsequent double press of the left side button places the transmitter back in first vehicle mode. Each vehicle mode of the 2-way transmitter should be thought of as an individual transmitter with its own unique code.<br><br><b>Test the Transmitter Battery</b><br><br><b>Note</b><br>This test should be performed prior to releasing the vehicle or transmitter to the customer. <br><br>All transmitter batteries should be tested immediately after installation of a 2-way remote start kit or replacement of a transmitter battery using the following procedure.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the unlock button on the transmitter eight times consecutively.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After the eighth press of the unlock button, observe the battery gauge located in the upper right corner of the LCD display. The gauge should read full (three bars inside the battery icon).<br><br>If after having a new battery installed, the battery goes dead within five months, the transmitter could have high sleep current, causing the battery to go dead. Replace the transmitter. <br><br>Please follow this diagnostic or repair process thoroughly and complete each step. If the condition exhibited is resolved without completing every step, the remaining steps do not need to be performed. <br><br><b>Determine if Transmitter is in Second Vehicle Mode</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press and release any of the face buttons on the 2-way transmitter and observe the display on power-up.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the 2-way transmitter is in second vehicle mode, the second vehicle icon will be displayed on the left side of the transmitter display. Is the 2-way transmitter in second vehicle mode?<br><br><b>If Yes, the 2-way transmitter is working properly.</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Press and release the left side button twice within one second. The 2-way transmitter should exit second vehicle mode.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Press and release the lock button. Press and release the unlock button. <br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>Confirm that the vehicle responds with the appropriate lock and unlock function. <br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span><b>If Yes</b> , the 2-way transmitter was in mode B.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Press and release the left side button twice within one second. The 2-way transmitter should enter second vehicle mode. <br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Use the "next available slot" method in the scan tool to program the 2-way transmitter to the 2-way RCDLR. Refer to Remote Control Door Lock Transmitter Programming in SI.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Both vehicle modes of the 2-way transmitter should now be coded to the vehicle.<br><br><b>If No:</b><br><br>The 2-way transmitter is not exhibiting the failure mode addressed by this bulletin. Refer to normal diagnostic procedures.<br><br><b>Parts Information</b><br><br>For part numbers, usage and availability of 2-way remote start, refer to the Accessory Parts Catalog or Corporate Bulletin Number 09-00-89-025A.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer</div>
