This diagnostic tests the evaporative emission (EVAP) system for a small leak when the key is turned OFF and the correct conditions are met. Heat from the exhaust system is transferred into the fuel tank while the vehicle is operating. When the vehicle is turned OFF and the EVAP system is sealed a change in the fuel tank vapor temperature occurs which results in a corresponding pressure change in the fuel tank vapor space. This change is monitored by the control module using the fuel tank pressure sensor input. With a leak in the system, the amount of pressure change will be less than that of a sealed system.<br><br><b>CONDITIONS FOR RUNNING THE DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTCs P0106, P0107, P0108, P0112, P0113, P0116, P0117, P0118, P0120, P0121, P0122, P0123, P0222, P0223, P0443, P0446, P0449, P0451, P0452, P0453, P0454, P0455, P0461, P0462, P0463, P0464, P0496, P0502, P0503, P0608, P0641, P0651, P01516, P2101, P2119, P2120, P2122, P2123, P2125, P2127, P2128, P2135, P2138 are not set.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition 1 voltage is between <b>10-16 volts</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The BARO is greater than <b>74 kPa</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>No fuel filling during the EONV test period.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The fuel level is between <b>15-85 percent</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The start-up engine coolant temperature (ECT) and the start-up intake air temperature (IAT) are between <b>0-40&deg;C (32-104&deg;F)</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The BARO is more than <b>74 kPa</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine run time before engine shut-off was greater than <b>10 minutes</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The drive distance before engine shut-off was more than <b>5 kilometers (3.1 miles)</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition is OFF.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ambient air temperature at the end of the drive cycle is between <b>0-32&deg;C (32-93&deg;F)</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTC P0442 runs once per drive cycle during the hot soak period after the ignition is turned OFF and may require up to <b>45 minutes</b> to complete.
