<h1>Interior Lighting Systems</h1><br><br><b>INTERIOR LIGHTING SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION</b><br><br><b>INTERIOR LAMPS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The interior lighting consists of 2 groups. The first group includes lamps that may not be dimmed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Courtesy/illuminated entry lamps<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Dome%20Lamp/">Dome lamps</a><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Map lamps<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Reading lamps<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vanity mirror lamps<br><br><b>COURTESY/ILLUMINATED ENTRY LAMPS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The courtesy/illuminated entry lamps, may be manually turned ON or OFF by placing the interior lamp switch in the ON or OFF position. If an outside door handle is lifted and a door is opened, the courtesy/illuminated entry lamps illuminate. After all the doors have been closed the courtesy/illuminated entry lamps will remain illuminated approximately <b>15 seconds</b>. The body control module (BCM) will then turn them OFF through the theater dimming feature. The courtesy/illuminated entry lamps will also turn ON prior to any door being opened, and remain illuminated approximately <b>40 seconds</b> when the driver removes the ignition key. When the driver places the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Dome%20Lamp/">dome lamp</a> defeat switch in the OFF position, the courtesy/illuminated entry lamps will be disabled.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The BCM, the door switches, and the liftgate module (LGM) (if equipped with power liftgate) communicate through the GMLAN serial data circuit for the lamp illumination commands of the doors, liftgate, and liftglass open/ajar switch signals. The LGM receives a ground signal from the pawl switch, ratchet switch, and liftglass ajar switch that are located within the liftgate latch and liftglass latch. For all vehicles, the left and right rear door latch switches are both on one circuit that is also an input to the BCM.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If the vehicle has a manual liftgate, there is an input circuit from the liftgate latch switch and liftglass latch switch directly to the BCM.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The left and right front door courtesy lamps receive voltage and ground from the driver <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Lighting%2520and%2520Horns/Door%2520Switch/index.html">door switch</a> and the passenger door switch respectively. The remaining <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Lighting%2520and%2520Horns/Courtesy%2520Lamp/index.html">courtesy lamps</a> are controlled and receive voltage from the BCM. Voltage for the courtesy lamp supply voltage circuit is from the INT LTS fuse in the instrument panel fuse block.<br><br><b>KEYLESS ENTRY INTERIOR ILLUMINATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the driver uses the door key in order to unlock the doors, the body control module (BCM) receives a door unlock signal. The BCM must have inputs or serial data messages that indicate that the ignition switch is OFF, the courtesy lamp switch is OFF and all the doors are closed. The BCM will then activate the interior lamps. The <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Lighting%2520and%2520Horns/Courtesy%2520Lamp/index.html">courtesy lamps</a> will remain ON, approximately <b>15 seconds</b> after the door is closed. The BCM will then turn them OFF through the theater dimming feature. If the door locks are activated to the LOCK position, or if the ignition switch is turned to either the RUN or CRANK position the courtesy lamps will turn OFF immediately.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the driver uses the remote function actuator transmitter to unlock the doors, trunk or presses the panic button, the BCM will keep the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Lighting%2520and%2520Horns/Courtesy%2520Lamp/index.html">courtesy lamps</a> ON approximately <b>40 seconds</b>. When the driver uses the remote function actuator transmitter to lock the doors, the BCM will keep the courtesy lamps on approximately <b>2 seconds</b>. If the ignition switch is turned to either the RUN or CRANK position the courtesy lamps will turn OFF immediately.<br><br><b>VANITY LAMPS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The inadvertent power supply voltage circuit of the body control module (BCM) provides battery positive voltage to each vanity mirror lamp. When the vanity mirror cover on the sunshade is opened, a switch closes to provide a ground circuit and the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Lighting%2520and%2520Horns/Vanity%2520Lamp/index.html">vanity lamp</a> illuminates.<br><br><b>READING LAMPS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The inadvertent power supply voltage circuit of the body control module (BCM) provides battery positive voltage to the reading lamps. The reading lamps and switch are integral to the courtesy/reading lamp assembly. When the switch is closed, voltage is supplied and the lamp illuminates.<br><br><b>BATTERY RUNDOWN PROTECTION/INADVERTENT POWER</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The body control module (BCM) inadvertent power supply voltage circuit provides battery positive voltage to all of the interior reading lamps, visor vanity mirror lamps, and <a>cargo lamps</a> if equipped. In the event that any of these lamps were to remain illuminated for a period of more than <b>10 minutes</b> with the ignition switch in the OFF position, the BCM will deactivate the inadvertent power supply voltage circuit to prevent a total battery discharge condition.<br><br><b>INTERIOR LAMPS DIMMING</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The second interior lighting group includes lamps which may be dimmed. This group may use a combination of vacuum fluorescent (VF) illumination, LED illumination and incandescent lamps.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the ignition switch is turned to the RUN position, the radio VF display turns ON at maximum brightness. When the park lamps are ON, all incandescent and LED back lighting turn ON at the dimming level indicated by the instrument panel (I/P) <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Instrument%2520Panel/Dimmer%2520Switch/index.html">dimmer switch</a>. At the same time all VF displays dim to match the indicated dimming level. The panel dimmer switch potentiometer is an input to the body control module (BCM). When the driver selects a dimming setting by moving the I/P dimming switch potentiometer, all incandescent back lighting lamps are provided with a specific voltage. When the I/P dimmer switch is moved from MIN to MAX, all VF displays, as well as all incandescent back lighting respond from minimum intensity to maximum brightness in response to the I/P dimmer switch.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The following switches and components have back lighting when the park lamps are ON:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The instrument panel cluster (IPC)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Window and heated seat switches<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Rear HVAC switches<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Sunroof switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Accessory switches<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fog lamp switches<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Rear parking assist (RPA) disable switches<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Transfer case shift control switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Roof beacon switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>PRNDL lamps<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Traction control switch<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Steering wheel control switches<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Headlamp leveling switch<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The left and right front <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Lighting%2520and%2520Horns/Door%2520Switch/index.html">door switch</a> illumination is controlled, receives voltage and ground from the driver door switch and passenger switch respectively. The radio is also a GMLAN module and has full control of its illumination.
