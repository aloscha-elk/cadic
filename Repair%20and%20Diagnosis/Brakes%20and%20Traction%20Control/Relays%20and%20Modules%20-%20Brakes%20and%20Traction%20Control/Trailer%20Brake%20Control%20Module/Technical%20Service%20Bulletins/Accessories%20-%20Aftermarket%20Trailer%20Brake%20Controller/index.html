Refer to SI Document ID# 1849049 - I/P Harness-Engine Compartment. Circuit 47 from the blunt cut wires near the data link connector will end at connector X126 terminal "G" or X115 terminal "B5." Obtain enough Dark Blue 12 gauge wire to run from X126/X115 to the 7-way trailer connector at the bumper. On one end of the Dark Blue wire attach terminal part number 15304732, located in Delphi Tray 8 and insert into X126 "G" or terminal part number 15304720 located in Delphi Tray 19 and insert into X115 "B5." Run the Dark Blue wire in its own conduit along the frame to the 7-way trailer connector at the bumper. Remove circuit 47 from the 7-way trailer connector terminal "C" and tape the bare terminal and attach to the harness. Attach terminal part number 12110853, located in Delphi Tray 4, to the other end of the Dark Blue wire and insert it into the 7-way trailer connector terminal "C."<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>ONLY For Vehicles Equipped with JL1</b>- The Red/Black wire, circuit 242, must be connected to stud #2 of the 30 Amp fuse of the underhood fuse block.

However, ITBC diagnostics will continue to function. If an ITBC fault is detected, a "Service Trailer Brake System" message will be displayed on the driver information center (DIC) and an appropriate DTC will be stored in the ITBC module. The operator will still be able to adjust gain and access the "Trailer Gain / Output" display page in the DIC. However, the factory installed ITBC system will not sense a trailer connection and will not provide output to the trailer.</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/64305278.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Locate the trailer brake control circuits that are looped and taped to the main harness under the instrument panel.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/64362849.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pull the trailering wire harness down.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/64406509.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Match the vehicle harness label circuit functions to the trailer brake controller jumper harness functions.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>The color or wires to be joined together may not match.</b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Dark Blue Wire: switched power from controller to trailer brakes<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Red with Black Stripe: fused vehicle power to electrical brake controller<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Light Blue with White Stripe: Brake switch input to power electric brake controller<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>White: ground<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Orange: CHMSL (Center High Mounted Stop Lamp) - not required with most systems<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/64428266.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After completing the under dash connections to the electric brake controller, open the hood and locate the red wire that is taped to the harness between the underhood electrical center and the driver side front fender.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Break the tape on the red/black wire and pull it toward the front of vehicle.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the lid from the electrical center.<br><br><b>Auxiliary Power (Applies to All LD and 2007-2009 HD's Only) Without JL1</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/64469769.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Circuit #742 for Auxiliary Power at the 7-way trailer connector is no longer connected by the GM Assembly Plant.
