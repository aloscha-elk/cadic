<h1>Video Entertainment System Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION</b><br><br><b>DISPLAY SCREEN</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The rear display screen shows video from either DVD movies, or an AUX input device, such as a video game console or <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Camera/">camera</a>. Each video screen has a dedicated video signal circuit to the radio.<br><br><b>AUX INPUTS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The AUX input jacks are standard color-coded RCA-style jacks. Video is yellow, right audio is red, and left audio is white. The jacks are located on the rear of the center console. A number of devices may be plugged into the AUX jacks, including, but not limited to video game consoles, digital cameras, camcorders, or other devices. Audio only sources can be played through the AUX jacks from portable audio devices. Turn on the rear seat audio (RSA), press the SOURCE key repeatedly until AUX is selected or touch the AUX screen button. An auxiliary device must be connected for the AUX screen button to appear as an option to select on the radio.<br><br><b>REAR SEAT AUDIO (RSA)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The rear seat audio (RSA) is integrated into the rear HVAC control module. Audio, video source are controlled by the radio through serial data communication. The rear speaker channels pass through the RSA. The rear seat audio can be muted by the RSA when in use. The rear seat entertainment (RSE) system includes a radio with a <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Accessories%2520and%2520Optional%2520Equipment/Entertainment%2520Systems/DVD%2520Player/index.html">DVD player</a>, a video display screen, 2 wireless headphones, and a <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Accessories%2520and%2520Optional%2520Equipment/Radio%252C%2520Stereo%252C%2520and%2520Compact%2520Disc/Remote%2520Control/index.html">remote control</a>. Vehicles equipped with a third row video display will include 3 wireless headphones.<br><br><b>WIRELESS HEADPHONES</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Wireless headphones are optional and allow for rear seat passengers to use the rear seat entertainment (RSE) or rear seat audio (RSA) functions without disturbing the listening of front seat passengers. The wireless headphones receive audio signals from the infrared (IR) transmitters on the overhead console. This transmission is line of sight only, so audio quality will be degraded if anything blocks the transmitter signal from reaching the headphones.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The wireless headphones include 2 channels. This allows rear seat passengers to utilize both RSE and RSA functions without disturbing one another. The toggle switch on the right side headphone earpiece switches between channel one and channel 2. RSE is broadcast on channel one, and RSA on channel 2.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>To use wireless headphones, turn them on using the power button on the left side headphone earpiece. Adjust volume using the rotary dial on the right side headphone earpiece.<br><br><b>WIRED HEADPHONE JACKS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The overhead console is equipped with two <b>2.5 mm</b> jacks for wired headphones. The headphones can be used to listen to either the rear seat entertainment (RSE) or rear seat audio (RSA) functions. If both RSE and RSA are used at the same time, the wired headphones receive only RSA audio.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>To use the wired headphones, plug the headphones into the jacks. Adjust the volume by pressing the headphone button on the left or right side of the RSA face, and then using the FWD or REV buttons to adjust the volume up or down. Visual indicators on the RSA display will indicate volume level. The left headphone button selects the left headphone jack for adjustment, and the right headphone button selects the right headphone for volume adjustment.</div>
