<h1>Power Seats System (Front)</h1><br><br><b>POWER SEATS SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION (FRONT)</b><br><br>There are 2 options of power seat systems available in full size trucks. The first is 6 way driver and passenger power seats without memory. The second is an 8-way driver seat plus 4-way lumbar with memory, heat and optional cool function. While the passenger has 8-way power seats with heat and optional cool function. For the driver memory seat operation, refer to Memory Seats Description and Operation. Power seats without memory are completely controlled through the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Body%2520and%2520Frame/Power%2520Seat%2520Switch/index.html">power seat switch</a>. Battery voltage is supplied to the power seat switch through the power seat circuit breaker. While the seat adjuster switches are in an inactive state the switch contacts are closed to the power seat switch ground circuit. When a power seat switch is pressed to an active state the switch contact is closed to the battery voltage supply circuit. Each seat adjuster motor is controlled by the power seat switch through 2 motor control circuits. The seat adjuster motors are bidirectional and the direction of adjuster motor rotation is determined by which of the adjuster motor control circuits is switched to battery voltage while the other remains grounded.</div>
