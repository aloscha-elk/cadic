<h1>Steering - Fluid Leak at Hose Connection to Rack</h1><b>TECHNICAL</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.:</b> 12-02-32-001A<br><br><b>Date:</b> February 21, 2013<br><br><b>Subject:</b> Hydraulic Power Steering Leak at Hose Connection to Steering Rack<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2007-2013 Cadillac Escalade Models<br>2007-2013 Chevrolet Avalanche, Silverado, Suburban, Tahoe<br>2007-2013 GMC Sierra, Yukon Models<br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to add the 2013 model year and change the tool part number in the Correction section. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 12-02-32-001 (Section 02 - Steering).<br><br><b>Condition</b><br><br>Some customers may comment on a fluid leak under the front of the vehicle. Upon further investigation, the technician may find fluid leaking from the power steering hose connection at the rack.<br><br>Based on parts returned to the Warranty Parts Center (WPC), replacement of both hose-to-rack "duckbill type" seals has corrected the condition. Replacement of the rack is not necessary for this issue.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/111832762.png"></div><br><br><br><br><b>Diagnostic Information</b><br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>All potential leaks should be completely cleaned and identified before attempting to repair or replace any power steering components.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Start diagnosis by inspecting the fluid level in the power steering reservoir. If the fluid level is NOT low, a careful analysis of the condition is necessary as it may involve a different type of fluid leak.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Visually inspect the area where the hose connection occurs.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Before the next step, check the bolt securing the hoses to the steering gear for proper torque (12 Nm or 126 lb in).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Clean the area around the connections, joints and seals with engine degreaser or equivalent.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Add fluorescent dye (such as Kent Moore GE 28431-6) to the <a href="../../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Steering/Power%2520Steering/Power%2520Steering%2520Fluid/index.html">power steering fluid</a>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Start the vehicle and allow the power steering system to reach normal operating temperatures.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the steering wheel to the stops in each direction while bumping the steering wheel against the stops 3-4 times. This will build maximum steering system pressure and help identify the source of the leak if present.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Caution</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DO NOT hold the steering wheel against the stops for more than 5 seconds as this will damage the power steering pump.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify the source of the leak is actually the hose connection to the power steer rack.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the source of the leak is from the hose to power steering rack connection, remove the bolt securing the hoses and replace the seals to correct the leak.

Place the replacement seal, P/N 26100863, in the counterbore and seat using the J-42640. Tap into place until the seal is firmly against the bottom of the counterbore. Do this for both ports.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Grasp the hose tubes and align to the ports. Insert the tube ends until you feel them "snug-up" in the seals. (Note: there will be a gap between the connection plate and the gear housing.) Do not allow the tube ends to come back out of the housing ports.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Align the connection plate bolt through the hole in the connection plate. Insert the bolt to the gear housing threaded hole and hand start.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive the bolt into the housing the remainder of the way utilizing the hex socket and ratcheting wrench. This will draw the hose tube ends into the ports and seat the connection plate.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Tighten</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tighten the bolt to 12 Nm (106 lb in).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Start the engine and exercise the steering system several times to bring the oil to operating temperature and inspect connection for leaks.<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>10.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If no leak is present, replace the chip cover and return the vehicle to the customer.<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>11.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If a leak presents itself, replace the hose assembly.
