When dismounting and mounting tires, care must be taken when breaking the bead loose from the wheel. If the tire machines bead breaking fixture is positioned too close to the tire pressure sensor, as the tire bead breaks away from the wheel it may be forced into, or catch on the edge of the tire pressure sensor. This can damage the sensor and require the sensor to be replaced.<br><br>Care must also be taken when transferring the tire bead to the other side of the wheel rim. As the tire machine rotates and the tire bead is stretched around the wheel rim, the bead can come in contact with the sensor if it is not correctly positioned in relation to the mounting/dismounting head prior to tire mounting/dismounting. This can also cause sensor damage requiring replacement.<br><br>Procedure<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Notice:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Use a tire changing machine in order to dismount tires. Do not use hand tools or tire irons alone in order to remove the tire from the wheel. Damage to the tire beads or the wheel rim could result.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Notice:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Do not scratch or damage the clear coating on aluminum wheels with the tire changing equipment.
