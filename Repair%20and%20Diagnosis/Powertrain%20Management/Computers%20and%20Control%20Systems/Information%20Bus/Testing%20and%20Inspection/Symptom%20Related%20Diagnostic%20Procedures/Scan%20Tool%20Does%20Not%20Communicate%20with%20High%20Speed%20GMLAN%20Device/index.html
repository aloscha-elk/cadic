However, there is no associated "current" or "active" status. Loss-of-communication U-codes such as these can set for a variety of reasons. Many times, they are transparent to the vehicle operator and technician, and/or have no associated symptoms. Eventually, they will erase themselves automatically after a number of fault-free ignition cycles. This condition would most likely be attributed to one of these scenarios:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>A control module on the data communication circuit was disconnected while the communication circuit is awake.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Power to one or more modules was interrupted during diagnosis<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>A low battery condition was present, so some control modules stop communicating when battery voltage drops below a certain threshold.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Battery power was restored to the vehicle and control modules on the communication circuit did not all re-initialize at the same time.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If a loss-of-communication U-code appears in history for no apparent reason, it is most likely associated with one of the scenarios above.
