Listed below are a few examples of those messages as well as additional guidelines:<br><br><b>Engine Crankcase Flushing</b><br><br><b>General Motors Corporation does not endorse or recommend engine crankcase flushing for any of its gasoline engines.</b> Analysis of some of the aftermarket materials used for crankcase flushing indicate incompatibility with GM engine components and the potential for damage to some engine seals and bearings. Damage to engine components resulting from crankcase flushing <b>IS NOT COVERED</b> under the terms of the New Vehicle Warranty.<br><br><b>Subsystem Flushing</b><br><br>Flushing of air conditioning (A/C) lines, radiators, transmission coolers, and power steering systems are recognized practices to be performed after catastrophic failures or extreme corrosion when encountered in radiators. For acceptable A/C flushing concerns, refer to the Flushing procedure in Service Information (SI). This practice is <b>not</b> required or recommended for normal service operations.<br><br>The use of external transmission fluid exchange or flush machines is <b>not</b> recommended for the automatic or manual transmission. Use of external machines to replace the fluid may affect the operation or durability of the transmission. Transmission fluid should only be replaced by draining and refilling following procedures in Service Information (SI). Refer to Automatic/Manual Transmission Fluid and Filter Replacement.<br><br><b>Approved Transmission Flushing Tool (Transmission Cooler Only)</b><br><br>The Automatic Transmission Oil Cooler Flow Check and Flush Tool <b>IS</b> recommended for GM vehicles. Refer to Transmission Fluid Cooler Flow Check and Flush in the Service Information website using the J-45096.<br><br><b>Our Commitment to providing Quality Service to Our Customers</b><br><br>Most customers appreciate and gain trust in the dealership that informs and offers them just what they need for continued trouble-free operation of their GM vehicle. Examine your service department's practices and verify that all Service Advisors and Technicians focus on providing a truly exceptional service experience through vehicle inspections and offering appropriate products at time of service. Use this opportunity to review the services you provide to your customers. Here are a few suggestions:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Take the time required to align your dealership service practices with the new GM Simplified Maintenance Schedule. Use the new vehicle Owner's Manual maintenance schedules to create a "mirror image" in your advertising and dealer service pricing that is easily understandable to your customer. Taking advantage of this new service strategy may greatly increase your dealership service sales and customer retention while decreasing inconvenience to your customer. Fully leveraging the Customer Sales and Service Retention marketing program, your dealership website and in-Market Retail funds will help you personalize your marketing for each customer.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Review your processes to ensure that your service team performs an Express Check-In on every vehicle visiting your service lane. Evaluate them for Oil Life remaining, interior condition, tire wear, wiper condition and windshield condition. Check engine oil and washer fluid levels and the condition of the battery and its cables. Invite your customer to join you as you inspect their vehicle. Use the Express Check-In form provided by GM to give the customer the knowledge of the results of your findings. Time permitting; further checks can be performed such as light function, OnStar OVD/DMN activation or GMPP registration. Both DMN and GMPP enrollment will grow your customer retention.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use the Goodwrench Service Inspection form when completing a service maintenance inspection. Be complete in your service recommendations. Use the Goodwrench Service Inspection process to document vehicle needs. This information can be integrated into your marketing efforts to the customer. Many dealers miss the services that are needed. Focus on overlooked but required maintenance that has real benefits to the customer. Many vehicles are equipped with cabin air filters. If these filters are used beyond replacement time, they may impede airflow decreasing A/C and heating performance. Make sure these filters are part of your service recommendations if needed. Note that some of our vehicles may not have been factory equipped but will accept the filters as an accessory.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Maintain your service expertise through GM Training and ASE Certification of your technicians.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Finally, take advantage of your service initiatives (National Account Tire, Quarterly Marketing Incentive, Goodwrench Service Maintenance, New Smart Wax Auto Detailing Products, OnStar Vehicle Diagnostic and dealer website service leads and Dealer Marketing Association (DMA) Promotions) to provide your customers with more reasons to identify your dealership as the best place to go for parts and service.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remember to utilize ALL of the service expertise and training you possess in your dealership to satisfy and provide a truly exceptional experience for all your customers. The local competition in your area is fierce. It's up to you and your team to exceed customer expectations every time. You have the expertise and are empowered to provide the necessary services, earn the trust of your customer and grow your business.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer</div>
