These stains are frequently milky, black, or greenish in appearance.

Most customers think of painted surfaces as the fenders, quarter panels and other exterior sheet metal. Many vehicles have painted brake calipers. Acidic wheel cleaners may craze, crack, or discolor the paint on the brake calipers. Damage from wheel cleaners is not covered under the vehicle new car warranty. Soap and water applied with a soft brush is usually all that is required to clean the calipers.<br><br>Whenever any wheel cleaner is used, it must be THOROUGHLY rinsed off of the wheel with clean, clear water. Special care must be taken to rinse under the hub cap, balance weights, wheel nuts, lug nut caps, between the wheel cladding and off the back side of the wheel. <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">Wheels</a> returned to the Warranty Parts Center (WPC) that exhibit damage from wheel cleaners most often have the damage around and under the wheel weight where the cleaner was incompletely flushed away.<br><br><b>Notice</b><br>Do not use cleaning solutions that contain hydrofluoric, oxalic and most other acids on chrome <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> (or any wheels).<br><br>If the customer is unsure of the chemical make-up of a particular wheel cleaner, it should be avoided.<br><br>For <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> showing signs of milky staining from acidic cleaners, refer to Customer Assistance and Instructions below.<br><br><b>Warranty of Stained Chrome <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">Wheels</a></b><br><br>Stained <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> are not warrantable.

As brakes are applied hot particles of brake material are thrown off and tend to be forced through the leading edge of the wheel spoke windows by airflow. These hot particles embed themselves in the chrome layer and create a small pit. If the material is allowed to sit on the wheel while it is exposed to moisture or salt, it will corrode the wheel beneath the chrome leaving a pit or small blister in the chrome.<br><br>Heavy brake dust build-up should be removed from <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> by using GM Chrome Cleaner and Polish, P/N 1050173 (in Canada use 10953013). For moderate cleaning, light brake dust build-up or water spots use SmartPolish, P/N 88865218 (in Canada, use 2675213). After cleaning, the wheel should be waxed using SmartWax, P/N 88865229 (in Canada, use 2675208), which will help protect the wheel from brake dust and reduce adhesion of any brake dust that gets on the wheel surface. For general <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">maintenance</a> cleaning, PEEK Metal Polish+ may be used.

The following product and procedure has been found to dramatically improve the appearance of stained wheels. For wheels that have milky stains caused by acidic cleaners try the following:<br><br><b>Notice</b><br>THE 3M CHROME AND METAL POLISH REQUIRED FOR THIS PROCEDURE IS AN EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE POLISH/CLEANER. THE <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">WHEELS</a> MUST BE CLEANED BEFORE APPLICATION TO AVOID SCRATCHING THE WHEEL SURFACE. THIS PRODUCT WILL REDUCE THE THICKNESS OF THE CHROME PLATING ON THE WHEEL AND IF USED INCORRECTLY OR EXCESSIVELY MAY REMOVE THE CHROME PLATING ALL TOGETHER, EXPOSING A LESS BRIGHT AND BRASSY COLORED SUB-LAYER. FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wash the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> with vigorously with soap and water. This step will clean and may reduce wheel staining.

ONLY apply and rub with sufficient force and time to remove enough staining that you are satisfied with the results. Some <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> may be stained to the extent that you may only achieve a 50% improvement while others may be able to be restored to the original lustre. IN ALL CASES, only apply until the results are satisfactory.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Apply 3M Chrome and Metal Polish #39527* with a clean terry cloth towel. As you apply the polish, the staining will be diminished.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When dry, buff off the polish with a clean portion of the towel.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Repeat application of the 3M Chrome and Metal Polish until satisfied with the results. If continued applications fail to improve the appearance further discontinue use.<br><br>This procedure will improve the appearance of the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> and may, with repeated applications, restore the finish dramatically. For wheels that exhibit spotting from road chemicals the above procedure may marginally improve the condition but will not restore the finish or remove the pitting. In this type of staining the wheel finish has actually been removed in spots and no manner of cleaning will restore the finish.<br><br>*We believe this source and their products to be reliable.
