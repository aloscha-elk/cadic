If a plus or minus circuit for any speaker output is shorted to ground or voltage, the radio disables the circuit for component protection and sets a diagnostic trouble code (DTC). The radio sets the speaker circuit DTC on non-amplified systems only. As the radio volume increases the voltage on the plus and minus circuits change to create a voltage difference between each other. The difference in voltage is what drives the voice coil of the speaker producing sound.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Radio Head Unit Dimming</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>GMLAN signal data received by the radio determines the radio dimming and backlighting levels.

The radio provides faceplate and control/graphics backlighting in the OFF (RAP inactive) when the exterior lighting virtual network (VN) is activated.

Even when out of a direct line of sight, the signal may be reflected into areas that would be in a "shadow" otherwise. Factors which affect the line of sight include:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Height of the broadcast antenna<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Height of the receiving antenna<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Terrain and buildings in the broadcast path<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>XM Reception</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>XM satellite radio provides digital radio reception. The XM signal is broadcast from two satellites and, where necessary, terrestrial repeaters. The high power satellites allow the antenna to receive the XM signal even when foliage and other partial obstructions block the antennas view of the satellite. Terrestrial repeaters are used in dense urban areas. These repeaters will receive the satellite signal and re-broadcast them at much higher power levels in order to ensure reception in areas with densely packed tall buildings.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>XM Satellite Radio</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>XM is a national satellite radio service that offers up to 100 coast to coast channels including music, news, sports, talk and children's programming. XM provides digital quality audio and text information, including song title and artist name. A service fee is required in order to receive the XM service. For more information, contact XM at www.xmradio.com or call 1-800-852-9696.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Digital <a>Radio Receiver</a></b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The radio controls communicate with the digital radio receiver via the serial data communication circuit.

By pressing and releasing the DISP or RCL button, you may view four different categories of information: Artist Name/Feature, Song/Program Title, Channel Category, and other Additional Information that may be broadcast on that channel. Additional Information messages may not always be available. If an Additional Information message is being broadcast on the tuned channel, the INFO icon will appear on the display. Each of the four information types may have multiple pages of text. To reach a category, press and release the DISP or RCL button consecutively until the desired type is displayed. If there are multiple pages of text for the selected information type, the radio will automatically display all the pages for that type at a rate of approximately one page every <b>three seconds</b> before timing out and returning to the default display. You may override this feature by pressing the DISP or RCL button to review all of the pages at your own pace.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Technical Information for the MP3/CD Radios (US8, US9 and UVA)</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The US8 and US9 radios will play both standard audio CDs and CD-Rs or CD-RWs. The CD-R/RWs may contain either standard audio (-.cda) or compressed audio (-.mp3). Customers who record their own music CD-R/RWs should be aware of the following:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The files can be recorded on a CD-R/RW disc with a maximum capacity of <b>700 MB</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The radio will play only compressed audio files recorded in the -.mp3 format. It also supports playlists that can be made and saved with popular MP3 software (in the -.m3u format). A playlist name must be no more than 32 characters in length. If the name of a playlist is longer than 32 characters, the radio will ignore the playlist.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The radio will only play audio from a CD-R/RW, it cannot record audio.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The radio will play a mixed mode CD-R/RW (one recorded with both -.cda and -.mp3 files). If a mixed mode CD is inserted in the radio, the radio will assign the standard CD audio to a directory which is listed as ROM audio directory.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The radio supports multi-session discs, but only the files from the last session will be played.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>There are a total of 20 directories (folders) allowed on a disc. The file structure can be 0-4 directories deep (a folder within a folder, within a folder, etc). Anything more than 20 directories will be ignored. Each directory may have up to 99 files contained within it. Files not having the -.mp3 extension will not be played, but still count toward the maximum. Anything more than the first 99 files within a directory will be ignored. A single disc may have up to 254 files and directories. Anything beyond the 254 limit will be ignored.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>MP3 files must be written to a CD-R/RW in one of the following industry-standard formats:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>ISO 9660 Level 1<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>ISO 9660 Level 2<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Juliet<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Romeo<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>ID3 tag information is displayed by the radio, if available.
