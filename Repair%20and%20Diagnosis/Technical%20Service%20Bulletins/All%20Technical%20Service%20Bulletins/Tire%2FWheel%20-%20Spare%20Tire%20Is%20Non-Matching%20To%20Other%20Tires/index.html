<h1>Tire/Wheel - Spare Tire Is Non-Matching To Other Tires</h1><b>INFORMATION</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.: </b>02-03-10-001E<br><br><b>Date: </b>November 01, 2010<br><br><b>Subject: </b><a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/Spare%2520Tire/index.html">Spare Tire</a> is a Different Size than Other <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">Tires</a><br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2002-2011 Cadillac Escalade Models<br>1999-2007 Chevrolet Silverado (Classic)<br>2000-2011 Chevrolet Suburban, Tahoe<br>2002-2011 Chevrolet Avalanche<br>1999-2007 GMC Sierra (Classic)<br>2001 GMC Sierra C3<br>2001-2011 GMC Yukon Models<br>2002-2011 GMC Sierra Denali<br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to update the model years. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 02-03-10-001D (Section 03 - Suspension).<br><br>This bulletin is being issued to supply additional information concerning the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/Spare%2520Tire/index.html">spare tire</a> on the above vehicles. You or your customers may have noticed that the spare tire has a 16-inch diameter steel wheel or 17-inch diameter aluminum wheel while the road <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> have a 17-inch, 18-inch, 20-inch or 22-inch diameter aluminum wheel. Although the spare tire has a different wheel diameter and may be a different brand, the rolling circumference is nearly identical to the road tires. The size difference will not cause a concern because the spare and the other tires will travel the same distance in one revolution.<br><br>This combination of non-matching <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> is used most often on full-size trucks. These vehicles use a road tire and wheel combination that may be too large to conveniently fit the storage compartment space of the vehicle. The customer may not be able to easily remove the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/Spare%2520Tire/index.html">spare tire</a>/wheel from the storage area because of its size and/or weight. A steel spare wheel, rather than an aluminum one, may be used since the spare is stowed under the vehicle where it is exposed to road and weather elements. A steel wheel is less likely to incur cosmetic damage while in the stowed position for long periods of time.<br><br>Please provide this information to your customers. Also, remind your customers of the importance of following the tire <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">maintenance</a> schedule as listed in their Owner Manual.
