<h1>Driveline Working Angles Adjustment</h1><br><br><b>Driveline Working Angles Adjustment</b><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>This procedure is intended to be used for vehicles where the following conditions are met:</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Vehicle trim heights are within specification guidelines.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>The vehicle exhibits no signs of aftermarket modifications that may affect driveline working angles.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>The vehicle exhibits no signs of accident damage which may affect the position of the drive axle, or axles, the propeller shaft support bearing, if equipped, or the transmission or transfer case, if equipped.</b><br><br><br><br><br>Drive axle wind-up may cause a launch shudder condition even when all of the driveline working angles are within specifications. Drive axle wind-up occurs when heavy torque during acceleration causes the pinion nose to pivot upward. Excessively worn or damaged axle mounting components and/or overloading or unevenly loading the vehicle may contribute to a launch shudder condition.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For solid axles equipped with a leaf spring suspension, inspect the leaf springs, mount bushings, and mounting hardware for excessive wear or damage.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For solid axles equipped with a non-leaf spring suspension, inspect the suspension links and link mounts and/or bushings for excessive wear or damage.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For direct-mount axles, inspect any axle mount brackets for damage and inspect the axle mounts and/or bushings for excessive wear or damage.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the structure to which the suspension attaches to ensure no deformities or damage exists.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the propeller shaft support bearing assembly for damaged rubber components, worn bearings, and/or a deformed/cracked bracket.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the propeller shaft support bearing assembly and mounting bracket, if equipped, for loose or missing shims.
