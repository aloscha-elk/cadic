<h1>4L80-E/4L85-E Automatic Transmission</h1><br><br><b>Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) Type Definitions</b><br><br>The DTC Type Definitions contain the characteristics for all types of DTCs. Each DTC type may or may not be found in this section. The DTC type is based on the action that the PCM takes when storing DTC information, and whether or not the PCM illuminates a service lamp or displays a message on a driver information center (DIC). The DTC descriptions in the Diagnostic Trouble Code List/Type are listed in numeric order and indicate the DTC types for domestic and export vehicle applications. Each DTC is categorized into one of the following types:<br><br><b>Type A</b><br><br>This DTC is emissions related. The PCM stores the DTC in History, Freeze Frame and Failure Records during the first trip in which the conditions for setting the DTC are met. The PCM also illuminates the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) during the first trip in which the conditions for setting the DTC are met.<br><br><b>Type B</b><br><br>This DTC is emissions related. The PCM stores the DTC in Failure Records during the first trip in which the conditions for setting the DTC are met. The PCM stores the DTC in History and Freeze Frame during the second consecutive trip in which the conditions for setting the DTC are met. The PCM also illuminates the MIL during the second consecutive trip in which the conditions for setting the DTC are met.<br><br><b>Type C</b><br><br>This DTC is non-emissions related. The PCM stores the DTC in History and Failure Records during the first trip in which the conditions for setting the DTC are met. The PCM does not store the DTC in Freeze Frame and does not illuminate the MIL. For some type C DTCs, a message may be displayed on a DIC, if equipped. For other type C DTCs, a separate service lamp, other than the MIL, may be illuminated. Type C DTCs that do not display a message on the DIC or illuminate a separate service lamp were formerly referred to as type D.<br><br><b>Type X</b><br><br>This DTC is available in the PCM software, but has been disabled, or turned off. In this case, the diagnostic does not run, DTCs are not stored, and the MIL does not illuminate. Type X DTCs are used primarily for export vehicles that do not require MIL illumination or DTC storing.<br><br>The service information contained in this manual refers to the domestic, federal, calibration package. Domestic calibrations apply to vehicles sold in the United States, Canada and Japan. Export calibrations exist for both leaded and unleaded vehicles. DTC types may change for some export vehicles, and some DTCs may be turned off for leaded export vehicles. Differences between domestic and export calibrations are not reflected on DTC support information pages. DTC types for export calibrations are referenced only in the Diagnostic Trouble Code List/Type. <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/A%2520L%2520L%2520%2520Diagnostic%2520Trouble%2520Codes%2520%2528%2520DTC%2520%2529/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Diagnostic%20Trouble%20Code%20Descriptions/">Diagnostic Trouble Code Descriptions</a><br><br></div>
