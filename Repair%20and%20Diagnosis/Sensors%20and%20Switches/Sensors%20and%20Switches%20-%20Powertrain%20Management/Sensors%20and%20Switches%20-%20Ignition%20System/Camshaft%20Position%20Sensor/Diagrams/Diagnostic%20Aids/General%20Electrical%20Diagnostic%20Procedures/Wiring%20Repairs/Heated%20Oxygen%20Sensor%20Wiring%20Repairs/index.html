<h1>Heated Oxygen Sensor Wiring Repairs</h1><br><br><b>HEATED OXYGEN SENSOR WIRING REPAIRS</b><br><br><b>TOOLS REQUIRED</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>J-38125 Terminal Repair Kit<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b>  Do not solder repairs under any circumstances as this could result in the air reference being obstructed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If the heated oxygen sensor pigtail wiring, connector, or terminal is damaged the entire oxygen sensor assembly must be replaced. Do not attempt to repair the wiring, connector, or terminals. In order for the sensor to function properly it must have a clean air reference. This clean air reference is obtained by way of the oxygen sensor signal and heater wires. Any attempt to repair the wires, connectors or terminals could result in the obstruction of the air reference and degrade oxygen sensor performance.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The following guidelines should be used when servicing the heated oxygen sensor:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not apply contact cleaner or other materials to the sensor or vehicle harness connectors. These materials may get into the sensor, causing poor performance. Also, the sensor pigtail and harness wires must not be damaged in such a way that the wires inside are exposed. This could provide a path for foreign materials to enter the sensor and cause performance problems.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Neither the sensor nor vehicle lead wires should be bent sharply or kinked. Sharp bends, kinks, etc., could block the reference air path through the lead wire.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not remove or defeat the oxygen sensor ground wire (where applicable). Vehicles that utilize the ground wire sensor may rely on this ground as the only ground contact to the sensor. Removal of the ground wire will also cause poor engine performance.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>To prevent damage due to water intrusion, be sure that the peripheral seal remains intact on the vehicle harness connector.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The engine harness may be repaired using the J-38125.</div>
