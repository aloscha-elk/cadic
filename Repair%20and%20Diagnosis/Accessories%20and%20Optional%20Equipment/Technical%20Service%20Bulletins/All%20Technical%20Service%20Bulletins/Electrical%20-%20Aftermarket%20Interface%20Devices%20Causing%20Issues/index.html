Monitoring devices, along with other electronic accessories such as aftermarket cruise control, or police speed checking devices (RADAR or LIDAR) may cause one or more of the concerns listed above.<br><br>Many of the problems described could be caused by an open connection on the HSCAN bus. Example: if the device only makes connection with one CAN +, then it will cause bus errors and erratic ECU behavior. <br><br>These devices may be removed by the customer for use in another vehicle while theirs is brought in for service. The intent of this bulletin is to identify a potential source of concerns that do not have other diagnostic methods to identify them. The examples below illustrate some of the devices encountered.<br><br><b>Examples:</b><br><br>The monitoring device examples are not specific to any one design, and styles will vary.<br><br><b>Device W/Secondary DLC Connector</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/211954376.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>This device has another DLC connector on it.
