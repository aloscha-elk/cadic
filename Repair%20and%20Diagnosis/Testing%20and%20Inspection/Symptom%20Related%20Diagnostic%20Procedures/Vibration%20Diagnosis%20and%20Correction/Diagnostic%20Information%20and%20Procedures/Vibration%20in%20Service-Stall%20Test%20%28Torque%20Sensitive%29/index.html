<h1>Vibration in Service-Stall Test (Torque Sensitive)</h1><br><br><b>Vibration in Service-Stall Test (Torque Sensitive)</b><br><br><b>Tools Required</b><br><br> J 38792-A Electronic Vibration Analyzer (EVA) 2<br><br><b>Notice:</b>  Do not fill the propeller shaft with foam, oil, or any other substance in order to correct a vibration. Filling the propeller shaft is only effective in reducing an unrelated condition called Torsional Rattle. Filling the propeller shaft should only be done in strict adherence to the procedure outlined in corporate bulletins that address Torsional Rattle. Failure to follow the correct procedure will induce a vibration and/or affect the structural integrity of the propeller shaft. The propeller shaft will then have to be replaced.<br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the ignition ON but do not start the engine.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Place the transmission in NEUTRAL.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Raise and support the vehicle.
