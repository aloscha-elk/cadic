<h1>Driveline System Balance Adjustment (Without EVA)</h1><br><br><b>Driveline System Balance Adjustment (Without EVA)</b><br><br>This procedure is designed to fine-tune the balance of a propeller shaft while it is mounted in the vehicle. Small amounts of residual imbalance which could be present in other related driveline system components could be compensated for as a result of performing this procedure. The end result of properly fine-tuning a propeller shaft balance may be either a significant reduction or an elimination of a vibration disturbance that is related to the first-order rotation of a propeller shaft.<br><br><br>Fine-tuning the balance of a propeller shaft can aid in achieving a more balanced total driveline system.<br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>The runout of the propeller shaft to be balanced and the runout of the components that the propeller shaft mates to must be within tolerances before an attempt should be made to perform this procedure.</b><br><br><br><br><b>Adjustment Procedure</b><br><br><b>Notice:</b>  Do not depress the brake pedal with the brake rotors and/or the brake drums removed, or with the brake calipers repositioned away from the brake rotors, or damage to the brake system may result.<br><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Raise and support the vehicle; ensure that the drive axle, or axles are supported at ride height - vehicle body supported by suspension components. Refer to  Lifting and Jacking the Vehicle .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>With the tire and wheel assemblies, and the brake rotors and/or brake drums removed from the drive axle(s), start the engine and turn OFF all engine accessories.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Place the transmission in forward gear.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Run the vehicle at the speed which causes the most vibration in the propeller shaft; observe which end of the propeller shaft exhibits the greatest amount of vibration disturbance.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Carefully hold a piece of chalk up to the end of the propeller shaft in order to just make contact as the shaft rotates.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the engine OFF to slow and stop the rotation of the propeller shaft.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Observe the location of the chalk mark on the propeller shaft.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the chalk mark circles the entire propeller shaft after the first attempt, remove the mark from the shaft and repeat steps 2 through 7; touch the chalk more gently to the propeller shaft.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the chalk mark circles the entire propeller shaft after the second attempt, runout of the propeller shaft may not be the cause of the disturbance. Proceed to step 16.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the chalk mark is only on a small portion of the propeller shaft, the mark identifies the heavy spot of the propeller shaft. The heavy spot of the propeller shaft will deflect downward during rotation. Place a small mark on the shaft 180 degrees, directly opposite the heavy spot, and identify the mark as the light spot. Proceed to step 8.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Install a band-type hose clamp to the propeller shaft as a weight, with the head of the clamp directly on the light spot, or 180 degrees, directly opposite the heavy spot.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Observe the amount of disturbance to the propeller shaft.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the amount of disturbance to the propeller shaft appears to be significantly reduced, the balance achieved may be sufficient and the vehicle should be road tested to determine the effect on the vibration concern. The head of the clamp can be moved very slightly, if necessary to refine the balance achieved.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the amount of disturbance to the propeller shaft appears to be almost unchanged or even increased, proceed to step 10.<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>10.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Add a second clamp to the propeller shaft, next to the first clamp and with the clamp heads aligned.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>11.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Observe the amount of disturbance to the propeller shaft.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the amount of disturbance to the propeller shaft appears to be significantly reduced, the balance achieved may be sufficient and the vehicle should be road tested to determine the effect on the vibration concern. The head of the clamps can be moved very slightly an equal distance apart on either side of the light spot, or moved slightly while still aligned, if necessary to refine the balance achieved.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the amount of disturbance to the propeller shaft appears to be almost unchanged or even increased, proceed to step 12.<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>12.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Move the position of the clamp heads an equal distance on either side of the light spot between 1 and 120 degrees apart from each other to reduce the total amount of weight in relation to the light spot.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>13.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Observe the amount of disturbance to the propeller shaft.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the amount of disturbance to the propeller shaft appears to be significantly reduced, the balance achieved may be sufficient and the vehicle should be road tested to determine the effect on the vibration concern.
