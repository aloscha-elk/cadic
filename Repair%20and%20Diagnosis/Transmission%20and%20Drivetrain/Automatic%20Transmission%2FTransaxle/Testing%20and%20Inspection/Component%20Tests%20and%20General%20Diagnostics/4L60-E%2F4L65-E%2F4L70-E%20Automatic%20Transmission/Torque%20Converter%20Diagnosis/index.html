<h1>Torque Converter Diagnosis</h1><br><br><b>Torque Converter Diagnosis</b><br><br>The torque converter clutch (TCC) is applied by fluid pressure, which is controlled by a pulse width modulation (PWM) solenoid valve. This solenoid valve is located inside of the automatic transmission assembly. The solenoid valve is controlled through a combination of computer controlled switches and sensors.<br><br><b>Torque Converter Stator</b><br><br>The torque converter stator roller clutch can have 2 different malfunctions.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The stator assembly freewheels in both directions.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The stator assembly remains locked up at all times.<br><br><b>Poor Acceleration at Low Speed</b><br><br>If the stator is freewheeling at all times, the vehicle tends to have poor acceleration from a standstill. At speeds above <b>50-55 km/h (30-35 mph),</b> the vehicle may act normally. For poor acceleration, you should first determine that the exhaust system is not blocked, and the transmission is in First gear when starting out.<br><br>If the engine freely accelerates to high RPM in NEUTRAL, you can assume that the engine and the exhaust system are normal. Check for poor performance in DRIVE and REVERSE to help determine if the stator is freewheeling at all times.<br><br><b>Poor Acceleration at High Speed</b><br><br>If the stator is locked up at all times, performance is normal when accelerating from a standstill. Engine RPM and vehicle speed are limited or restricted at high speeds. Visual examination of the converter may reveal a blue color from overheating.<br><br>If the converter has been removed, you can check the stator roller clutch by inserting a finger into the splined inner race of the roller clutch and trying to turn the race in both directions. You should be able to freely turn the inner race clockwise, but you should have difficulty in moving the inner race counterclockwise or you may be unable to move the race at all.<br><br><b>Noise</b><br><br><b>Important:</b> <b>Do not confuse this noise with pump whine noise, which is usually noticeable in PARK, NEUTRAL and all other gear ranges. Pump whine will vary with line pressure.</b><br><br>You may notice a torque converter whine when the vehicle is stopped and the transmission is in DRIVE or REVERSE. This noise will increase as you increase the engine RPM. The noise will stop when the vehicle is moving or when you apply the torque converter clutch, because both halves of the converter are turning at the same speed.<br><br>Perform a stall test to make sure the noise is actually coming from the converter:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Place your foot on the brake.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Put the gear selector in DRIVE.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Notice:</b> You may damage the transmission if you depress the accelerator for <b>more than 6 seconds.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Depress the accelerator to <b>approximately 1,200 RPM for no more than six seconds.</b><br><br>A torque converter noise will increase under this load.<br><br><b>Torque Converter Clutch Shudder</b><br><br>The key to diagnosing TCC shudder is to note when it happens and under what conditions.<br><br>TCC shudder which is caused by the transmission should only occur during the apply or the release of the converter clutch. Shudder should never occur after the TCC plate is fully applied.<br><br><b>If Shudder Occurs During TCC Apply or Release</b><br><br>If the shudder occurs while the TCC is applying, the problem can be within the transmission or the torque converter. Something is causing one of the following conditions to occur:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Something is not allowing the clutch to become fully engaged.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Something is not allowing the clutch to release.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The clutch is releasing and applying at the same time.<br><br>One of the following conditions may be causing the problem to occur:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Leaking turbine shaft seals<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A restricted release orifice<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A distorted clutch or housing surface due to long converter bolts<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Defective friction material on the TCC plate<br><br><b>If Shudder Occurs After TCC has Applied</b><br><br>If shudder occurs after the TCC has applied, most of the time there is nothing wrong with the transmission.<br><br>The TCC is not likely to slip after the TCC has been applied. Engine problems may go unnoticed under light throttle and load, but they become noticeable after the TCC apply when going up a hill or accelerating. This is due to the mechanical coupling between the engine and the transmission.<br><br>Once TCC is applied, there is no torque converter (fluid coupling) assistance. Engine or driveline vibrations could be unnoticeable before TCC engagement.<br><br>Inspect the following components in order to avoid misdiagnosis of TCC shudder. An inspection will also avoid the unnecessary disassembly of a transmission or the unnecessary replacement of a torque converter.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Spark plugs-Inspect for cracks, high resistance or a broken insulator.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Plug wires-Look in each end. If there is red dust (ozone) or a black substance (carbon) present, then the wires are bad. Also look for a white discoloration of the wire. This indicates arcing during hard acceleration.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Coil-Look for a black discoloration on the bottom of the coil. This indicates arcing while the engine is misfiring.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fuel injector-The filter may be plugged.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vacuum leak-The engine will not get a correct amount of fuel. The mixture may run rich or lean depending on where the leak occurs.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>EGR valve-The valve may let in too much or too little unburnable exhaust gas and could cause the engine to run rich or lean.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>MAP/MAF sensor-Like a vacuum leak, the engine will not get the correct amount of fuel for proper engine operation.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Carbon on the intake valves-Carbon restricts the proper flow of air/fuel mixture into the cylinders.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Flat cam-Valves do not open enough to let the proper fuel/air mixture into the cylinders.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Oxygen sensor-This sensor may command the engine too rich or too lean for too long.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fuel pressure-This may be too low.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine mounts-Vibration of the mounts can be multiplied by TCC engagement.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Axle joints-Check for vibration.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Throttle position (TP) Sensor-The TCC apply and release depends on the TP Sensor in many engines. If the TP Sensor is out of specification, TCC may remain applied during initial engine loading.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Cylinder balance-Bad piston rings or poorly sealing valves can cause low power in a cylinder.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fuel contamination-This causes poor engine performance.<br><br>Replace the torque converter if any of the following conditions exist:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>External leaks appear in the hub weld area.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The converter hub is scored or damaged.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The converter pilot is broken, damaged, or fits poorly into the crankshaft.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>You discover steel particles after flushing the cooler and the cooler lines.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The pump is damaged, or you discover steel particles in the converter.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle has TCC shudder and/or no TCC apply. Replace the torque converter only after all hydraulic and electrical diagnoses have been made. The converter clutch material may be glazed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The converter has an imbalance which cannot be corrected.
