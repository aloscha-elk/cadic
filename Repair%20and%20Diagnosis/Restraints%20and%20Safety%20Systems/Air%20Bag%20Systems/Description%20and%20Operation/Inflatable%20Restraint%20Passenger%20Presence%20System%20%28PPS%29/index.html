<h1>Inflatable Restraint Passenger Presence System (PPS)</h1><br><br><b>INFLATABLE RESTRAINT PASSENGER PRESENCE SYSTEM (PPS)</b><br><br><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  The Passenger Presence System (PPS) is a calibrated unit. When replacing the assembly all parts in the service kit must remain together. Do not mix any of the old parts with the new parts. After repairing or replacing the PPS, the system must be rezeroed in order to function properly.<br><br>The PPS is used to monitor the weight of an occupant on the front outboard passenger seat and communicate the status to the sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) whether to enable or suppress the deployment of the instrument panel (I/P) module. The PPS consist of an electronic control module, silicone filled sensor pad, pressure sensor, <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Restraints%2520and%2520Safety%2520Systems/Seat%2520Belt%2520Tension%2520Sensor/index.html">seat belt tension sensor</a>, wiring harness, and PASSENGER AIR BAG ON/OFF indicator. The silicone filled sensor pad is located under the passenger seat foam cushion and is connected by a hose clamped to the pressure sensor. The weight of the occupant sitting in the front passenger seat is measured as a pressure change within the bladder by the pressure sensor. The pressure sensor sends a voltage signal to the PPS module. If the pressure from the occupants weight is less than a specified value, the PPS module will send a suppress signal to the SDM to disable the I/P module. If the pressure from the occupants weight is higher than a specified value, the PPS module will send an enable signal to the SDM to enable the I/P module. The PPS module will notify the customer of the enable/disable status by turning on one of the PASSENGER AIR BAG ON/OFF indicator located on the overhead console. The PPS monitors itself for faults and will set diagnostic trouble codes (DTC) if a fault is detected. The PPS will also notify the SDM of a fault and the SDM will set DTC B0081 and request the instrument panel cluster (IPC) to turn ON the AIR BAG indicator located on the IPC.</div>
