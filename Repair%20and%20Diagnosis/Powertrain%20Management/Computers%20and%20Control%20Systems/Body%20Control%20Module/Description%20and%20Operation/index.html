<h1>Body Control Module: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>BODY CONTROL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION</b><br><br>The body control system consists of the body control module (BCM), communications, and various input and outputs. Some inputs, outputs and messages require other modules to interact with the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Body%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">BCM</a>. The BCM also has discrete input and output terminals to control the vehicle's body functions. The BCM is wired to the GMLAN high speed serial data buss and the GMLAN low speed serial data buss and acts as a gateway between them. If the BCM does not communicate the vehicle will not start due to the inability of the engine control module (ECM)/powertrain control module (PCM) and theft deterrent module (TDM) to communicate without the BCM providing the gateway function.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Power Mode Master</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>This vehicles body control module (BCM) functions as the power mode master (PMM). The ignition switch is a low current switch with multiple discrete ignition switch signals to the PMM for determination the power mode that will be sent over the serial data circuits to the other modules that need this information, and so the PMM will activate relays and other direct outputs of the PMM as needed. Refer to Power Mode Description and Operation for a complete description of power mode functions.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Serial Data Gateway</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The body control module (BCM) in this vehicle functions as a gateway or translator. The purpose of the gateway is to translate serial data messages between the GMLAN high speed buss and the GMLAN low speed buss for communication between the various modules. The gateway will interact with each network according to that network's transmission protocol.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>One example of this necessary communication is the communication between the engine control module (ECM)/powertrain control module (PCM) which is high speed serial data and Theft Deterrent Module which is low speed serial data. If these modules can not exchange information, the vehicle will not start.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Communication between the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Body%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">BCM</a> and a scan tool can be on the high speed GMLAN network or low speed GMLAN network. If one network is lost, the BCM can still communicate with the scan tool. A lost communication DTC typically is set in modules other than the module with a communication failure.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Body%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">Body Control Module</a></b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The various body control module (BCM) input and output circuits are described in the corresponding functional areas indicated on the BCM electrical schematics.
