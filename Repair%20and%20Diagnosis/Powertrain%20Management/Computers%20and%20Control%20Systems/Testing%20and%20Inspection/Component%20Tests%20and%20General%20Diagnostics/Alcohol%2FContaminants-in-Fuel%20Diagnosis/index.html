<h1>Alcohol/Contaminants-in-Fuel Diagnosis</h1><br><br><b>ALCOHOL/CONTAMINANTS-IN-FUEL DIAGNOSIS</b><br><br><b>TEST DESCRIPTION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Water contamination in the fuel system may cause driveability conditions such as hesitation, stalling, no start, or misfires in one or more cylinders. Water may collect near a single <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Fuel%2520Injector/index.html">fuel injector</a> at the lowest point in the fuel injection system and cause a misfire in that cylinder. If the fuel system is contaminated with water, inspect the fuel system components for rust or deterioration.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Ethanol concentrations of greater than <b>10 percent</b> in nonblended gasoline, or greater than <b>85 percent</b> with E85 blended gasoline for flexible fuel applications, can cause driveability conditions such as hesitation, lack of power, stalling, or a no start, and may contribute to fuel system corrosion, deterioration of fuel system components, and a restricted <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Tune-up%20and%20Engine%20Performance%20Checks/Fuel%20Filter/">fuel filter</a>.<br><br><b>SYSTEM VERIFICATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The fuel sample should be drawn from the bottom of the tank so that any water present in the tank will be detected. The sample should be bright and clear.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the sample appears cloudy, or contaminated with water, as indicated by a water layer at the bottom of the sample, perform the Particulate Contaminants in Fuel Testing Procedure.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If alcohol contamination is suspected, perform the Alcohol in Fuel Testing procedure.<br><br><b>ALCOHOL IN FUEL TESTING WITH SPECIAL TOOL</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Test the fuel composition using J 44175 and Instruction Manual.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If water appears in the fuel sample, clean the fuel system.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Subtract 50 from the reading on the DMM in order to obtain the percentage of alcohol in the fuel sample.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the nonblended gasoline fuel sample contains more than <b>15 percent</b> ethanol, or if the E85 blended gasoline fuel sample contains more than <b>85 percent</b> ethanol, add fresh regular gasoline to the vehicles's <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Test the fuel composition.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If additional testing indicates that the ethanol percentage is still more above <b>15 percent</b> for a nonblended gasoline sample, drain and replace the vehicle's fuel. Refer to Fuel System Cleaning. If additional testing indicates that the E85 blended gasoline sample is still above <b>85 percent</b>, continue adding fresh, regular gasoline until the ethanol content is <b>85 percent</b> or less.  <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Service%2520and%2520Repair/index.html">Service and Repair</a><br><br><b>ALCOHOL IN FUEL TESTING WITHOUT SPECIAL TOOL</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Using a <b>100 ml (3.38 oz)</b> specified cylinder with <b>1 ml (0.034 oz)</b> graduation marks, fill the cylinder with fuel to the <b>90 ml (3.04 oz)</b> mark.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Add <b>10 ml (0.34 oz)</b> of water in order to bring the total fluid volume to <b>100 ml (3.38 oz)</b> and install a stopper.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Shake the cylinder vigorously for <b>10-15 seconds</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Carefully loosen the stopper in order to release the pressure.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Re-install the stopper and shake the cylinder vigorously again for <b>10-15 seconds</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Put the cylinder on a level surface for approximately <b>5 minutes</b> in order to allow adequate liquid separation. If alcohol is present in the fuel, the volume of the lower layer, which would now contain both alcohol and water, will be more than <b>10 ml (0.34 oz)</b>. For example, if the volume of the lower layer is increased to <b>15 ml (0.51 oz)</b>, this indicates at least <b>5 percent</b> alcohol in the fuel. The actual amount of alcohol may be somewhat more because this procedure does not extract all of the alcohol from the fuel.<br><br><b>PARTICULATE CONTAMINANTS IN FUEL TESTING PROCEDURE</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Using an approved fuel container, draw approximately <b>0.5 liter (0.53 qt)</b> of fuel.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Place the container on a level surface for approximately <b>5 minutes</b> in order to allow settling of the particulate contamination. Particulate contamination will show up in various shapes and colors. Sand will typically be identified by a white or light brown crystals. Rubber will appear as black and irregular particles.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Observe the fuel sample. If any physical contaminants or water are present, clean the fuel system.<br><br><b>Repair Instructions</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Perform the Diagnostic Repair Verification after completing the diagnostic procedure.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Fuel System Cleaning.  <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/A%2520L%2520L%2520%2520Diagnostic%2520Trouble%2520Codes%2520%2528%2520DTC%2520%2529/Testing%2520and%2520Inspection/Verification%2520Tests/index.html">Verification Tests</a><br></div>
