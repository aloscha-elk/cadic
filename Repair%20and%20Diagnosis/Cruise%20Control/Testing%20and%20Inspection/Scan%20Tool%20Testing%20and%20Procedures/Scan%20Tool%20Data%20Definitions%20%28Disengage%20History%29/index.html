Also, the brake pedal being applied according to the brake fluid pressure sensor input can also set this disengagement reason with vehicles equipped with the vehicle stability enhancement system (VSES).<br><br><b>BPP Data:</b>  The ECM detects an invalid brake pedal apply serial data message from the platform module.<br><br><b>BPP DTC:</b>  The ECM detects that DTC P0703 is active.<br><br><b>Cancel:</b>  The ECM detects that the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Cruise%2520Control/index.html">cruise control</a> cancel switch has been activated.<br><br><b>Clutch:</b>  The ECM detects that the clutch pedal switch has been activated.<br><br><b>Coast Disengage:</b>  When the ECM detects that the cruise set/coast signal is active and the throttle blade fully closes the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Cruise%2520Control/index.html">cruise control</a> system will disengage until the ECM detects that the set/coast signal is inactive. The cruise control system will then engage and set with the new vehicle speed.<br><br><b>Coast Speed Low:</b>  The ECM detects that the Set/Coast switch is activated until the vehicle speed is below <b>37 km/h (23 mph)</b>.<br><br><b>Cruise S/W:</b>  The ECM detects that a <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Cruise%2520Control/index.html">cruise control</a> software execution error is present.<br><br><b>Cruise Sw Data:</b>  A fault in the serial data circuit from the <a>cruise control switch</a> to the platform module is detected.<br><br><b>Cruise Sw.

It is also possible that a tire with low air pressure can also set this disengagement reason.<br><br><b>Trans.
