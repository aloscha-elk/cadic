The VLOM consists of 4 electrically operated normally closed solenoids, which directs pressurized engine oil to 8 deactivating valve lifters. All 4 VLOM solenoids are connected in parallel to a fused ignition circuit supplied by the powertrain relay. The control circuit for each solenoid is connected to an individual low side driver internal to the ECM. When enabling conditions for V4 mode are met, the ECM will command the low side driver to turn ON, in engine <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Tune-up%2520and%2520Engine%2520Performance%2520Checks/Firing%2520Order/index.html">firing order</a> sequence.<br><br><b>DIAGNOSTIC AIDS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The VLOM solenoids are assigned to the following engine cylinders:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Solenoid #1-Cylinder #1<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Solenoid #2-Cylinder #4<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Solenoid #3-Cylinder #6<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Solenoid #4-Cylinder #7<br><br><b>CIRCUIT/SYSTEM VERIFICATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If any DTCs are set, then repair those DTC first.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Start and idle the engine.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Allow the engine to reach normal engine operating temperature.
