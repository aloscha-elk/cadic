<h1>Power Door Locks Inoperative (Rear)</h1><br><br><b>POWER DOOR LOCKS INOPERATIVE (REAR)</b><br><br><b>DIAGNOSTIC FAULT INFORMATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Perform the Diagnostic System Check - Vehicle prior to using this diagnostic procedure.  <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Initial%20Inspection%20and%20Diagnostic%20Overview/">Initial Inspection and Diagnostic Overview</a><br><br><b>CIRCUIT/SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The driver and passenger door lock and side window switches are integrated control module switch assemblies. The DDS and PDS door lock switches are normally open, 2 position rocker type switches, with detents for lock and unlock. The DDS and PDS are directly connected to the respective door lock actuator through the door lock actuator control circuits. When a door lock or unlock function is activated from the DDS or PDS a GMLAN lock or unlock command is sent to the other door switch and body control module (BCM). The <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Body%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">BCM</a> controls the rear door and liftgate lock actuators through a printed circuit board relay in the IP fuse block. The unlock side of the relay is controlled by the BCM through a low side drive control circuit and the lock side of the relay is controlled through a high side drive control circuit. When the BCM grounds the door unlock relay control circuit, the unlock relay coil is energized and battery voltage is supplied to the unlock actuator control circuits through the unlock fuses 1 and 2. During unlock operation the actuators are grounded through the lock control circuits to the lock fuses 1 and 2 and the de-energized lock side of the relay. When the BCM supplies voltage the lock relay control circuit, the lock relay coil is energized and battery voltage is supplied to the lock actuator control circuits through the lock fuses 1 and 2. During lock operation the actuators are grounded through the unlock control circuits to the unlock fuses 1 and 2 and the de-energized unlock side of the relay.<br><br><b>CIRCUIT/SYSTEM VERIFICATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that a test lamp connected to ground illuminates on the supply side of the unlock fuses 1 and 2 when an unlock switch is activated.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the test lamp does not illuminate at either fuse perform the Rear <a>Door Lock Relay</a> Control Circuit Test.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the test lamp does not illuminate at one fuse only perform the appropriate Actuator Circuit Test.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that a test lamp connected to ground illuminates on the supply side of the lock fuses 1 and 2 when a lock switch is activated.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the test lamp does not illuminate at either fuse perform the Rear <a>Door Lock Relay</a> Control Circuit Test.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the test lamp does not illuminate at one fuse only perform the appropriate Actuator Circuit Test.<br><br><b>CIRCUIT/SYSTEM TESTING</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Rear <a>Door Lock Relay</a> Control Circuit Test</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that a test lamp connected to battery voltage illuminates when connected to each of the lock and unlock 1 and 2 fuses in the IP fuse block.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the test lamp does not illuminate at all 4 fuses test the IP fuse block ground circuit for an open/high resistance.
