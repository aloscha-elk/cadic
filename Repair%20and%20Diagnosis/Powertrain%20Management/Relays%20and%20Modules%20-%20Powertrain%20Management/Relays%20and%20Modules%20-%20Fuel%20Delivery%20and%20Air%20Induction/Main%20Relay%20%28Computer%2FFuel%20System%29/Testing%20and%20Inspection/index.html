The relay armature is held in the open position by spring tension. Battery positive voltage is supplied directly to the relay coil and the armature contact at all times. The engine control module (ECM) supplies the ground path to the relay coil control circuit via an internal integrated circuit called an output driver module (ODM). The ODM output control is configured to operate as a low side driver for the powertrain relay. The ODM for the powertrain relay also incorporates a fault detection circuit, which is continuously monitored by the ECM. When the ECM commands the powertrain relay ON, ignition 1 voltage is supplied to the ECM, and to several additional circuits.<br><br><b>DIAGNOSTIC AIDS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>This test procedure requires that the vehicle battery has passed a load test and is completely charged. Refer to Battery Inspection/Test.  <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Starting%2520and%2520Charging/Testing%2520and%2520Inspection/Component%2520Tests%2520and%2520General%2520Diagnostics/Battery%2520Inspection%252FTest/index.html">Battery Inspection/Test</a><br><br><b>CIRCUIT/SYSTEM VERIFICATION</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>IMPORTANT:</b> On the scan tool, the powertrain relay is referred to as the EC <a>ignition relay</a>.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition ON, engine OFF, command the powertrain relay ON and OFF several times using the scan tool output control function.
