The engine control module (ECM) supplies <b>5 volts</b> to the ECT sensor signal circuit and supplies a ground to the low reference circuit.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The purpose of this diagnostic is to analyze the performance of the thermostat by using the ECT sensor to determine if the engine coolant will increase at the correct rate, and also to meet the calibrated target temperatures under various operating conditions.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The ECM uses the start-up ECT and the start-up intake air temperature (IAT) to begin the diagnostic calculation. The air flow into the engine is accumulated, and vehicle speed, distance, and engine run time are also factored in, to determine if the ECT does increase normally, and reach the calibrated target temperatures.<br><br><b>CONDITIONS FOR RUNNING THE DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTCs P0101, P0102, P0103, P0106, P0107, P0108, P0112, P0113, P0116, P0117, P0118, P0171, P0172, P0174, P0175, P0502, P0503 are not set.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The start-up IAT is more than <b>-7&deg;C (+19&deg;F)</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The start-up ECT is less than <b>70&deg;C (158&deg;F)</b>, when the IAT is above <b>10&deg;C (50&deg;F)</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The start-up ECT is less than <b>50&deg;C (122&deg;F)</b>, when the IAT is below <b>10&deg;C (50&deg;F)</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine run time is between <b>90 seconds</b> and <b>22 minutes</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle has traveled more than <b>2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles)</b> at more than <b>8 km/h (5 mph)</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The accumulated airflow is between <b>20-75 g/s</b>, with the minimum average airflow more than <b>10 g/s</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The fuel ethanol percentage is less than <b>85 percent</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>This DTC runs once per ignition cycle within the enabling conditions.<br><br><b>CONDITIONS FOR SETTING THE DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The ECM detects that the minimum ECT of <b>75&deg;C (167&deg;F)</b> has not been met, when the IAT is more than <b>10&deg;C (50&deg;F)</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>OR<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The ECM detects that the minimum ECT of <b>55&deg;C (131&deg;F)</b> has not been met, when the IAT is less than <b>10&deg;C (50&deg;F)</b>.<br><br><b>ACTION TAKEN WHEN THE DTC SETS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>DTC P0128 is a Type B DTC.<br><br><b>CONDITIONS FOR CLEARING THE MIL/DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>DTC P0128 is a Type B DTC.<br><br><b>DIAGNOSTIC AIDS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Inspect the ECT sensor terminals for corrosion, and for engine coolant leaking through the sensor.<br><br><b>CIRCUIT/SYSTEM VERIFICATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the ignition has been OFF for 8 hours or more, the ECT and the IAT, should be within <b>6&deg;C (11&deg;F)</b> of each other and also the ambient temperature.
