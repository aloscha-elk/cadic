<h1>Adjustable Pedals (W/O Memory)</h1><br><br><b>ADJUSTABLE PEDALS DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION (W/O MEMORY)</b><br><br>The adjustable pedals system is controlled by the adjustable pedals switch and the adjustable pedals relay and operation can occur only while the transmission selector lever is in the park position. The adjustable pedals assembly is moved forward or rearward by a motor which is fixed to the brake pedal actuator with a drive cable to the accelerator pedal actuator. In an inactive state both of the outputs to the motor are closed to ground. The adjustable pedals switch controls the adjustable pedals relay by applying battery voltage to one of the coils. The adjustable pedals motor is bidirectional and the direction of the pedal assembly travel is determined by which of the relay output circuits is switched to battery positive voltage while the other remains grounded. The adjustable pedals system uses the same motor and sensor assembly even when it is not equipped with the memory seats. The adjustable pedals position sensor is not used and does not have any circuits connected. The adjustable pedals position manually controlled by activating the switch in the forward or rearward direction until the desired position is reached.</div>
