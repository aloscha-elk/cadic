<h1>Power Seat Inoperative (With Memory)</h1><br><br><b>POWER SEAT INOPERATIVE (W/MEMORY)</b><br><br><b>DIAGNOSTIC FAULT INFORMATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Perform the Diagnostic System Check - Vehicle prior to using this diagnostic procedure.  <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Initial%20Inspection%20and%20Diagnostic%20Overview/">Initial Inspection and Diagnostic Overview</a><br><br><b>CIRCUIT/SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The 8-way power driver seat with memory is controlled by the memory seat module (MSM). The low current battery supply circuit from the DSM 10A fuse supplies the logic power and reference voltages to the MSM. The high current battery supply circuit from the DRIVER SEAT 2 <b>25A</b> circuit breaker supplies the MSM power rail 1 which is used to drive the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Seats/Power%2520Seat%2520Motor/index.html">power seat motors</a>, adjustable pedals motor, and seat heater elements with heated seats only. The MSM supplies a battery voltage reference circuit to the seat adjuster and lumbar switches. The switch signal circuits are referenced from ground within the MSM and when a switch is activated the signal circuit goes high. Each seat adjuster motor is controlled by the MSM through 2 motor control circuits. While the seat adjuster motors are in an inactive state the motor control circuits are closed to ground circuit contacts within the MSM. The MSM operates the seat adjuster motors by switching one of a motors control circuits to battery voltage. The seat adjuster motors are bidirectional and the direction of adjuster motor rotation is determined by which of the adjuster motor control circuits is switched to battery voltage while the other remains grounded.<br><br><b>CIRCUIT/SYSTEM VERIFICATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Install a scan tool and display the MSM switch inputs.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that none of the switches are displayed as Active while in an inactive state.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If any of the switch inputs are Active, perform the affected Switch Circuit Test.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that the switch inputs are displayed as Active while the switch is pressed.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If any of the switch inputs remain Inactive while the switch is pressed, perform the affected Switch Circuit Test.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the switch inputs to the MSM function normal, perform the Motor Control Circuit Test.<br><br><b>CIRCUIT/SYSTEM TESTING</b><br><br><b><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Seat Adjuster Switch Circuit Test</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Disconnect the MSM connector C7 and verify that none of the adjuster switch inputs are displayed as Active.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If any of the switch inputs are Active, replace the MSM.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that battery voltage is not present at the affected switch signal circuit terminal while the switch is inactive.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If battery voltage is present while the switch is not pressed, replace the seat adjuster switch.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that battery voltage is present at the affected switch signal circuit terminal while pressing the switch.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If battery voltage is not present while the switch is pressed, repair the switch supply circuit for an open/high resistance.
