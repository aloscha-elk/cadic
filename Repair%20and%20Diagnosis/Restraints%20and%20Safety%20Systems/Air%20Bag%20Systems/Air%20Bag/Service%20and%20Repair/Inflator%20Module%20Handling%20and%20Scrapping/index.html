An inflator module deployment produces a rapid generation of gas. This may cause the inflator module, or an object in front of the inflator module, to project through the air in the event of an unlikely deployment.<br><br><b>DUAL STAGE INFLATOR MODULE</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Dual stage inflator modules have 2 deployment stages. If stage 1 was used to deploy a dual stage inflator module, stage 2 may still be active. Therefore, a deployed dual stage inflator module must be treated as an active module. If disposal of a dual stage module is required, both deployment loops must be energized to deploy the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Restraints%20and%20Safety%20Systems/Air%20Bag%20Systems/Air%20Bag/">air bag</a>.<br><br><b>SCRAPPING PROCEDURE</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>During the course of a vehicles useful life, certain situations may arise which will require the disposal of a live and undeployed inflator module. Do NOT dispose a live and undeployed inflator module through normal disposal channels until the inflator module has been deployed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Do not deploy the inflator module in the following situations:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After replacement of an inflator module under warranty - the inflator module may need to be returned undeployed to the manufacturer.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the vehicle is the subject of a Product Liability report, GM-1241, related to the SIR system and is subject to a preliminary investigation - do NOT alter the SIR system in any manner.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the vehicle is involved in a campaign affecting the inflator modules - follow the instructions in the Campaign Service Bulletin for proper SIR handling procedures.<br><br><b>DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURES</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>You can deploy the inflator module either inside or outside of the vehicle. The method used depends upon the final disposition of the vehicle.

Undeployed inflator modules contain substances that could cause severe illness or personal injury if their sealed containers are damaged during disposal. Use the following deployment procedures to safely dispose of an undeployed inflator module. Failure to observe the following disposal methods may be a violation of federal, state, or local laws.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>TOOLS REQUIRED</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>J 39401-B SIR Deployment Fixture<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>J 38826 SIR Deployment Harness<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>An appropriate pigtail adapter<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn OFF the ignition.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the ignition key.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Put on safety glasses.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the inflator module.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If you are removing the steering wheel module, refer to Inflatable Restraint Steering Wheel Module Replacement.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If you are removing the I/P module, refer to Inflatable Restraint Instrument Panel Module Replacement.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If you are removing a roof rail module, refer to Inflatable Restraint Roof Rail Module Replacement (Front LH, Extended Wheelbase) Inflatable Restraint Roof Rail Module Replacement (Front LH, Standard Wheelbase) Inflatable Restraint Roof Rail Module Replacement (Front RH, Extended Wheelbase) Inflatable Restraint Roof Rail Module Replacement (Front RH, Standard Wheelbase) Inflatable Restraint Roof Rail Module Replacement (Rear LH, Avalanche/Escalade EXT) Inflatable Restraint Roof Rail Module Replacement (Rear LH, Extended Wheelbase) Inflatable Restraint Roof Rail Module Replacement (Rear LH, Standard Wheelbase) Inflatable Restraint Roof Rail Module Replacement (Rear RH, Avalanche/Escalade EXT) Inflatable Restraint Roof Rail Module Replacement (Rear RH, Extended Wheelbase) Inflatable Restraint Roof Rail Module Replacement (Rear RH, Standard Wheelbase).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>CAUTION:  Refer to SIR Inflator Module Handling and Storage Caution.</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/477195578.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Place the inflator module on a work bench, with the vinyl trim cover facing up and away from the surface.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/477196640.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Clear a space on the ground about 1.85 m (6 ft) in diameter for deployment of the inflator module or deployment fixture.
