The DT-47825 bolts to the mounting surface of the control solenoid (w/body and TCM) valve assembly. Compressed air is attached to the test block, through the control solenoid (w/body and TCM) valve assembly solenoid passage and back to a pressure gage on the test plate, sent through the control solenoid (w/body and TCM) valve assembly solenoid, and back to the test plate pressure port. <br><br>An air pressure gage is used to display the air passing through the solenoid. If the solenoid is unable to allow air through or the air is constantly flowing through the solenoid may be stuck. The scan tool is used to command the solenoids On and Off while watching the air pressure test gage to determine if the solenoid is functioning correctly. The recommended shop air pressure for this test is <b>620.5-689.4 Kpa (90-100 psi).</b><br><br><b>Control Solenoid (w/Body and <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Transmission%2520Control%2520Systems/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520A%252FT/Control%2520Module/index.html">TCM</a>) Valve Assembly with Control Solenoid Test Plate</b><br><br><h3>Control Solenoid (w/Body and TCM) Valve Assembly with Control Solenoid Test Plate:</h3><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/363683368.png"></div><br><br><br><b>1</b> - Filter Plate Assembly<br><b>2</b> - Control Solenoid Valve Assembly<br><b>3</b> - DT-47825 Control Solenoid Test Plate<br><b>4</b> - Air Connection Port<br><b>5</b> - Transmission 16-Way Pass-Through Connector<br><b>6</b> - Electrical Connector Slide Lock<br><br><b>Important:</b> <b>To avoid solenoid overheating and possible internal damage, do not continuously operate the solenoid for more than 2 minutes at a time.</b><br><br>The <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Transmission%2520Control%2520Systems/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520A%252FT/Control%2520Module/index.html">TCM</a> will normally cycle some of the transmission solenoids On and Off to keep the solenoid passages clean and clear, This is a normal function and will cause the valves to cycle open and closed quickly when the TCM is powered up.
