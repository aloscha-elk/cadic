This diagnostic directs the service technician to the appropriate system diagnosis. This diagnostic assumes the vehicle system voltage levels are adequate for starter motor operation. Refer to Battery Inspection/Test and Engine Cranks Slowly. The fuel level supply must be adequate, and the fuel quality must be able to sustain the combustion process.  <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Starting%2520and%2520Charging/Testing%2520and%2520Inspection/Component%2520Tests%2520and%2520General%2520Diagnostics/Battery%2520Inspection%252FTest/index.html">Battery Inspection/Test</a>  <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Starting%2520and%2520Charging/Testing%2520and%2520Inspection/Symptom%2520Related%2520Diagnostic%2520Procedures/Engine%2520Cranks%2520Slowly/index.html">Engine Cranks Slowly</a><br><br><b>DIAGNOSTIC AIDS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When disconnecting electrical connectors or removing fuses and relays from a fuse block, always inspect both mating electrical terminals for corrosion and terminal tightness.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use the J 35616 Connector Test Adapter Kit for any test that requires probing the underhood fuse block terminals, component wire harness terminals, or the ECM wire harness terminals.<br><br><b>CIRCUIT/SYSTEM VERIFICATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Attempt to start the engine.
