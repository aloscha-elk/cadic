<h1>Testing for Electrical Intermittents</h1><br><br><b>TESTING FOR ELECTRICAL INTERMITTENTS</b><br><br>Perform the following procedures while wiggling the harness from side to side. Continue this at convenient points (about 6 inches apart) while watching the test equipment.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Testing for Short to Ground<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Testing for Continuity<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Testing for a Short to Voltage<br><br>If the fault is not identified, perform the procedure below using the MIN MAX feature on the J 39200 DMM. This feature allows you to manipulate the circuit without having to watch the J 39200. The J 39200 will generate an audible tone when a change is detected.<br><br><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  The J 39200 must be used in order to perform the following procedure since the J 39200 can monitor current, resistance or voltage while recording the minimum (MIN), and maximum (MAX) values measured.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connect the J 39200 to both sides of a suspected connector (still connected), or from one end of a suspected circuit to the other.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Set the rotary dial of the J 39200 to the V (AC) or V (DC) position.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the range button of the J 39200 in order to select the desired voltage range.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the MIN MAX button of the J 39200. The J 39200 displays 100 ms RECORD and emits an audible tone (beep).<br><br><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  The 100 ms RECORD mode is the length of time an input must stay at a new value in order to record the full change.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Simulate the condition that is potentially causing the intermittent connection, either by wiggling the connections or the wiring, test driving, or performing other operations. Refer to Inducing Intermittent Fault Conditions.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Listen for the audible Min Max Alert which indicates that a new minimum or maximum value has been recorded.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the MIN MAX button once in order to display the MAX value and note the value.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press the MIN MAX button again in order to display the MIN value and note the value.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Determine the difference between the MIN and MAX values.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the variation between the recorded MIN and MAX voltage values is <b>1 volt</b> or greater an intermittent open or high resistance condition exists. Repair the condition as necessary.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the variation between the recorded MIN and MAX voltage values is less than <b>1 volt</b> an intermittent open or high resistance condition does not exist.</div>
