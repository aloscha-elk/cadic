<h1>Brake Rotor Clean-Up Procedure</h1><b>BRAKE ROTOR CLEAN-UP PROCEDURE</b><br><br>Clean-up the rotors on an approved, well-maintained brake lathe to guarantee smooth, flat and parallel surfaces. Check for clean and true lathe adapters and make sure the arbor shoulder is clean and free of debris or burrs. For more information see the "Brake Lathe Calibration Procedure" section in this bulletin.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>On the outboard area of the rotor, position the cutting tools one eighth of an inch into the <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Brakes%2520and%2520Traction%2520Control/Disc%2520Brake%2520System/Brake%2520Pad/index.html">brake pad</a> area of the rotor. Feed the cutting tools into the rotor until they cut the rotor to new metal, a full 360 degrees. Zero each dial and back off a full turn.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Move the cutting bits to the middle of the rotor and do the same procedure. If zero is passed during the process, reset zero. Back off a full turn.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Position the cutting bits one eighth of an inch inside the inboard (closest to the hub) edge of the <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Brakes%2520and%2520Traction%2520Control/Disc%2520Brake%2520System/Brake%2520Pad/index.html">brake pad</a> contact area. Do the same procedure. If zero is passed during the process, reset zero.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Back off a full turn and position the cutting bits all the way inboard in preparation to refinish the full rotor surface. Advance both tool cutters to the zero setting plus just enough to clean up the entire rotor surface.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After completing the refinish, sand both sides of the rotor for approximately one minute per side using a sanding block and 130-150 grit sandpaper to obtain a non-directional finish.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Only remove the necessary amount of material from each side of the rotor and note that equal amounts of material do not have to be removed from both sides on any brake system using a floating caliper.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>In many of these instances, such a minimal amount of material is removed from the rotor that customer satisfaction is not a concern for future brake services. This procedure is intended to "Clean-up" the rotor surface and should be conveyed to the customer as such - not as "cut", "refinish" or "machine", which tends to be terms understood as a substantial reduction of rotor material/life. If the brake lathe equipment being used is not capable of removing minor amounts of material while holding tolerances, further lathe maintenance, repair, updates or equipment replacement may be necessary.<br><br></div>
