<h1>Overdrive Range, 3-2 Downshift</h1><br><br><b>Overdrive Range, 3-2 Downshift</b><br><br>Similar to a forced 4-3 downshift, a forced 3-2 downshift can occur because of minimum throttle (coastdown conditions), heavy throttle or increased engine load. In order to achieve a forced 3-2 downshift, the PCM energizes the 2-3 shift solenoid valve and the following changes occur:<br><br>Energized by the PCM, the normally open solenoid closes and blocks the signal B fluid from exhausting through the solenoid. This creates pressure in the signal B fluid circuit at the solenoid end of the 2-3 shift valve.<br><br><b>2-3 Shift Valve Train</b><br><br>The signal B fluid pressure from the shift solenoid moves both valves to the downshift position against AFL fluid pressure acting on the 2-3 shift valve. This causes the following changes:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The AFL fluid is blocked from the D432 fluid circuit and the D432 fluid exhausts past the 2-3 shuttle valve.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The 2nd fluid is blocked from feeding the 3-4 signal fluid circuit and the 2nd fluid is routed into the servo feed fluid circuit.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The 3-4 signal fluid is exhausted past the valve. The 3-4 <a>clutch fluid</a> and the 3rd accumulator fluid, which were fed by the 3-4 signal fluid, also exhaust.<br><br><b>3-4 Clutch Releases and 2-4 Band Applies</b><br><br><b>3-4 Clutch Piston</b><br><br>The 3-4 <a>clutch fluid</a> exhausts from the piston and the 3-4 clutch plates are released.<br><br><b>3-4 Clutch Exhaust Checkball (#4)</b><br><br>Exhausting 3-4 <a>clutch fluid</a> seats the #4 checkball and is forced through orifice #13. This orifice controls the 3-4 clutch fluid exhaust and the 3-4 clutch release rate.<br><br><b>2-4 Servo Assembly</b><br><br>The 3rd accumulator fluid exhausts from the servo assembly. The 2nd <a>clutch fluid</a> pressure moves the 2nd apply piston against the servo return spring force in order to move the apply pin and apply the 2-4 band.<br><br><b>3-2 Downshift Valve and 1-2 Upshift Checkball (#8)</b><br><br>The 3-4 <a>clutch fluid</a> exhausts from the valve and the spring force moves the valve into the second gear position. However, before the spring force overcomes the exhausting 3-4 clutch fluid pressure, the 2nd fluid feeds the 2nd clutch fluid circuit through the valve. This bypasses the control of orifice #16 at the #8 checkball and provides a faster 2-4 band apply. Remember that the #8 checkball and orifice #16 are used to help control the 2-4 band apply during a 1-2 upshift.<br><br><b>Downshift Timing and Control</b><br><br>At higher vehicle speeds, the 2-4 band apply must be delayed to allow the engine speed RPM to increase sufficiently for a smooth transfer of engine load to the 2-4 band. Therefore, exhaust of the 3rd accumulator fluid must be delayed. However, at lower speeds the band must be applied quickly. In order to provide for the varying requirements for the 2-4 band apply rate, the exhausting 3rd accumulator fluid is routed to both the 3rd accumulator checkball (#2) and the 3-2 control valve.<br><br><b>3rd Accumulator Checkball (#2)</b><br><br>The exhausting 3rd accumulator fluid seats the #2 checkball and is forced through orifice #12. This fluid exhausts through the 3-4 clutch and the 3-4 signal fluid circuits and past the 2-3 shift valve. Orifice #12 slows the exhaust of the 3rd accumulator fluid and delays the 2-4 band apply rate.<br><br><b>3-2 Control Solenoid Valve and 3-2 Control Valve</b><br><br>These components are used to increase the exhaust rate of 3rd accumulator fluid, as needed, depending on the vehicle speed.<br><br>The 3-2 control solenoid valve is a normally closed On/Off solenoid controlled by the PCM.
