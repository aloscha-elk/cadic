The heated and cooled seat switches are located in the HVAC control module. When a heated or cooled seat switch is pressed a serial data message from the HVAC control module is sent to the memory seat module (MSM) indicating the heat/cool seat request. The MSM then sends a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal through the appropriate heated/cooled seat mode signal circuit to the climate control seat module (CCSM) to activate the heated or cooled seat function. The CCSM then applies battery voltage to the seat cushion and <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Seats/Seat%2520Back/index.html">seat back</a> thermal electronic devices (TEDs) and a pre-determined voltage to the blower motors. To determine seat temperature, the CCSM supplies a 5 volt signal and a low reference to the temperature sensors that are attached to each TED. The temperature sensors are variable resistors, their resistance changes as the temperature of the seat changes. Then based on the seat temperature, the CCSM controls the voltage level that it applies to the TEDs and blower motors.<br><br><b>Diagnostic Aids</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The following conditions must be met in order to perform valid tests when diagnosing the climate control seat system:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The ignition must be cycled OFF then ON between each test in order to reset the CCSM.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The engine must be running in order to supply the CCSM with the amount of current needed to operate the heated/cool seat system.<br><br><b>Reference Information</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Schematic Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Heated/Cooled Seat Schematics <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Seats/Seat%2520Temperature%2520Element/Diagrams/Electrical%2520Diagrams/index.html">Electrical Diagrams</a><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Connector End View Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Heated/Cooled Seat Connector End Views <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Seats/Seat%2520Temperature%2520Element/index.html#Diagrams/Connector%20Views/">Connector Views</a><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Electrical Information Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Circuit Testing <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Connector Repairs <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Testing for Intermittent Conditions and Poor Connections <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Wiring Repairs <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Component%20Tests%20and%20General%20Diagnostics/">Component Tests and General Diagnostics</a><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Scan Tool Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Scan Tool Data List <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Seats/Seat%2520Temperature%2520Element/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Scan%20Tool%20Testing%20and%20Procedures/">Scan Tool Testing and Procedures</a><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Scan Tool Data Definitions <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Seats/Seat%2520Temperature%2520Element/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Scan%20Tool%20Testing%20and%20Procedures/">Scan Tool Testing and Procedures</a><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Scan Tool Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Scan Tool Data List <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Seats/Seat%2520Temperature%2520Element/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Scan%20Tool%20Testing%20and%20Procedures/">Scan Tool Testing and Procedures</a><br><br><b>Circuit/System Verification</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition ON, observe the HVAC control panel while pressing and releasing the appropriate heated or cooled seat switch.
