<h1>Service Procedure</h1><b>Service Procedure</b><br><br>Technicians are to confirm that the customer is aware that this safety recall is being performed on their vehicle prior to performing the repair. <br>If a customer refuses to have this safety recall performed on their vehicle, dealers are to provide the customer with a copy of the "Notice to Customer" document provided in this bulletin, record on the repair order "customer declined recall repair" and, if possible, have the customer sign the repair order. A labor code is provided for customers who refuse the repair. This labor code will not close the recall. If the customer, or a new owner, decides at a later date to have the recall performed, perform the repair and submit the claim using the appropriate V labor code.<br><br>This service procedure will permanently disable and remove the heated windshield washer fluid system. After performing the procedure, dealers are to issue a $100 USD/$105 CDN check to the customer of record as compensation for the loss of this feature (see Q&A section of this bulletin for additional details). Involved vehicles currently in dealer/retailer new or used car inventory are not eligible for a check. However, all new vehicles currently in dealer/retailer inventory will be re-invoiced with appropriate dealer credit for the elimination of this feature.<br><br><br></div>
