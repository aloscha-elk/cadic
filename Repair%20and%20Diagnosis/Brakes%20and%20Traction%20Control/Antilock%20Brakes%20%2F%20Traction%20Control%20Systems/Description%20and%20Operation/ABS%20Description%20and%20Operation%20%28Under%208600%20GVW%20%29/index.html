During antilock braking, hydraulic pressure in the individual wheel circuits is controlled to prevent any wheel from slipping.

However, certain failures cannot be detected unless active diagnostic tests are performed on the components. Shorted solenoid coil or motor windings, for example, cannot be detected until the components are commanded ON by the EBCM. Therefore, a power-up self-test is required at the beginning of each ignition cycle to verify correct operation of components before the various control systems can be enabled. The EBCM performs the first phase of the power-up self-test when the ignition is first turned ON. The system relay, solenoids and the ABS pump motor are commanded ON and OFF to verify proper operation and the EBCM verifies the ability to return the system to base braking in the event of a failure. The master cylinder pressure sensor performs a self-test by sending a series of specific voltage signals to the EBCM, each for a predetermined amount of time. This phase of the power-up self-test may be heard by the driver, depending on how soon the engine is cranked and started after turning ON the ignition. The second phase of the power-up self-test begins when the vehicle is driven at a speed <b>greater than 12 km/h (7.5 mph)</b> and the EBCM has not detected any traction control module (TCS)/vehicle stability enhancement system (VSES) related malfunctions thus far. When the brake switch indicates that the brake is not applied and the master cylinder pressure is detected as being low, the EBCM proceeds with the test. The EBCM isolates all of the wheels by closing the 4 isolation valves. Due to the fact that all of the wheels are isolated during the second phase of the test, the test must be aborted if the brake is applied while the test is being performed. Occasionally, the driver may detect this by experiencing a momentary hard pedal.<br><br><b>VSES Sensors Initialization</b><br><br>The vehicle stability enhancement system (VSES) sensors values may vary slightly due to differences in temperature, sensor mounting, connector resistances, manufacturing, etc. Since VSES is a very sensitive and precise control system, it is imperative that the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Brakes%2520and%2520Traction%2520Control/Electronic%2520Brake%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">electronic brake control module</a> (EBCM) be able to accurately equate a given sensor voltage with an actual unit of measurement. For example, the yaw rate signal of one vehicle may be <b>2.64 volts at +18.0 deg/sec</b> yaw rate while the yaw rate signal of another vehicle may be <b>2.64 volts at +17.5 deg/sec</b> yaw rate. Therefore, at the beginning of each ignition cycle, the EBCM must perform an initialization procedure to observe how the VSES sensors are correlated with each other and also to determine what each sensor value is when the applicable unit of measurement equals 0. This voltage is referred to as the sensor bias voltage. Although some activation of the VSES system may occur if required to prior to full initialization, the system does not give optimum performance until the sensors are fully initialized.<br><br>The following VSES sensors require initialization:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Brakes%2520and%2520Traction%2520Control/Yaw%2520Rate%2520Sensor/index.html">yaw rate sensor</a><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a>lateral accelerometer</a><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The master cylinder pressure sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The steering wheel position sensor<br><br>When the vehicle speed is <b>greater than 25 km/h (15 mph),</b> full sensor initialization must occur during <b>3 km (1.8 mi)</b> of driving or <b>1 km (0.6 mi)</b> of straight and stable driving, whichever occurs first. Although an attempt at initialization may fail due to driving conditions, such as driving on a very winding road, failed initialization is usually caused by a sensor bias voltage which is not within an acceptable range. Often, a DTC sets soon after a failed initialization attempt.

This reaction occurs even if the ABS indicator turns OFF when the scan tool is used to clear the DTCs. When repairing these vehicles, it is important to ensure that the ECE 13 response has occurred and that the ABS indicator does not illuminate after returning the vehicle to the customer. It is also important to verify that ECE 13 is not the cause of an ABS indicator which is illuminated when no DTCs are set, before attempting to diagnose other possible causes.<br><br><b>Active Vacuum Booster</b><br><br>The power brake booster assist unit creates mechanical force for the brake booster in case of a vacuum loss or low vacuum to the brake booster.
