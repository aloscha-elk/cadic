<h1>Drive Range, Fifth Gear Default</h1><br><br><b>Drive Range, Fifth Gear Default</b><br><br>If the transmission is in 4th, 5th or 6th gear during a transmission electrical component failure, the transmission will default to 5th gear. All solenoids will default to their normal state. If the torque converter clutch was applied, it will release. The transmission will stay in 5th gear default range until the ignition has been turned off or transmission shifted to reverse. When the vehicle is restarted, and shifted back into drive, the transmission will then operate in the 3rd gear default range. This default action will enable the vehicle to be safely driven to a service center.<br><br><b>3-5 Reverse Clutch Applies</b><br><br><b>C35R Pressure Control Solenoid 2</b><br><br>The C35R pressure control solenoid 2 defaults to ON, allowing <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Transmission%2520Control%2520Systems/Actuators%2520and%2520Solenoids%2520-%2520Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Actuators%2520and%2520Solenoids%2520-%2520Differential/Actuator/index.html">actuator</a> feed fluid to enter the pressure control solenoid (PCS) 35 reverse clutch fluid circuit. PCS 35 reverse clutch fluid is routed through orifice #48 and then to the 3-5 reverse clutch regulator valve. PCS 35 reverse clutch fluid is also routed through orifice #40 and then to the 3-5 reverse clutch boost valve.<br><br><b>3-5 Reverse Clutch Boost Valve</b><br><br>PCS 3-5 reverse clutch fluid pressure acts on a differential area moving the PCS 3-5 reverse clutch boost valve against the 3-5 reverse clutch boost valve spring. The 3-5 reverse clutch fluid passes through the valve and enters the 3-5 reverse clutch feedback circuit. As PCS 3-5 reverse clutch fluid pressure is increased to a given value, the 3-5 reverse clutch boost valve opens the 3-5 reverse clutch feedback circuit to exhaust. This results in the 3-5 reverse clutch regulator valve moving to the full feed position sending full 3-5 reverse clutch feed pressure (full line pressure) to the clutch.<br><br><b>3-5 Reverse Clutch Regulator Valve</b><br><br>PCS 3-5 reverse clutch fluid moves the 3-5 reverse clutch regulator valve against 3-5 reverse clutch regulator valve spring force and 3-5 reverse clutch feedback fluid. This allows 3-5 reverse feed to pass through the valve and enter the 3-5 reverse clutch circuit. The 3-5 reverse clutch fluid is then routed to the 3-5 reverse clutch, the 3-5 reverse boost valve and the clutch select valve 2. When the 3-5 reverse clutch regulator valve is in this position, PS1 fluid from the pressure switch 1 exhausts through the valve, allowing the switch to close.<br><br><b>3-5 Reverse Clutch</b><br><br>The 3-5 reverse clutch fluid enters the 1-2-3-4 and 3-5 reverse clutch housing to move the piston against spring force combined with force from the compensator to apply the 3-5 reverse clutch plates.<br><br><b>Clutch Select Valve 3</b><br><br>Once the clutch select valve 3 is moved to the ON position in 4th gear, it will remain in this position throughout the 5th gear default range, until the ignition has been turned OFF. When the ignition is OFF, fluid will exhaust from the valve, thus when the vehicle is restarted, the transmission will then be in the 3rd gear default range.<br><br><b>1-2-3-4 Clutch Releases or 2-6 Clutch Releases</b><br><br><b>C1234 Pressure Control Solenoid 5</b><br><br>If the transmission was in 4th gear when an electrical condition commands a protection mode, the C1234 pressure control solenoid 5 defaults to the OFF position, allowing PCS 1234 <a>clutch fluid</a> from the 1-2-3-4 clutch, the 1-2-3-4 clutch regulator valve and 1- 2-3-4 clutch boost valve to exhaust.<br><br><b>2-6 CB26 Pressure Control Solenoid 4</b><br><br>If the transmission was in 6th gear when an electrical condition commands a protection mode, the CB26 pressure control solenoid 4 defaults to the OFF position, allowing PCS 26 <a>clutch fluid</a> from the 2-6 clutch regulator valve, and the 2-6 clutch to exhaust.<br><br><b>Torque Converter Clutch Releases</b><br><br><b>TCC Pressure Control Solenoid</b><br><br>The torque converter clutch (TCC) pressure control solenoid will default to it's normal state, OFF. PCS TCC fluid will exhaust from the TCC control valve, and spring force will shuttle the valve to the off position. TCC apply fluid will then be routed to the cooler, and TCC release fluid will be routed to the torque converter for complete TCC release.<br><br><b>Drive Range, Fifth Gear Default</b><br><br><h3>Drive Range, Fifth Gear Default:</h3><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/334085693.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br></div>
