Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 07-08-50-020 (Section 08 - Body and Accessories).<br><br>Some customers may report that the heated seats operate for only one or two seconds and then turn off or stop working. The cooling function of the seats appear fully operational.<br><br>If you encounter this concern, ensure that the customer is leaving the heated portion of the switch on for five to ten minutes. When the seat is commanded to the hot position, nine volts is sent to the blower motor for only two seconds. The voltage then drops to seven volts. This gives the appearance that the seat blower motor, and the heated seat is only working for a short time and then shutting off.<br><br>When the seat is commanded to the cold position, nine volts is continuously sent to the blower motor. The sound of the blower motor is easily heard when the radio is off.<br><br>This is normal operation of the heated/cooled seats. No repairs should be attempted for this concern.<br><br>If you determine that the heated seats are not functioning correctly, check for loose, bent or backed out terminals at the connectors listed below. Ensure that the terminals listed are fully seated into the connector. Repair any terminals/connections as needed.
