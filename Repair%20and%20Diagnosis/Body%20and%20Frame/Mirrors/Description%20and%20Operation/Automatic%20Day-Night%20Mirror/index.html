<h1>Automatic Day-Night Mirror</h1><br><br><b>AUTOMATIC DAY-NIGHT MIRROR DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION</b><br><br><b>INSIDE REARVIEW MIRROR WITH THE AUTOMATIC DAY-NIGHT FEATURE SYSTEM COMPONENTS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The inside rearview mirror with the automatic day-night feature system consists of the following components:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inside rearview mirror<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ambient air temperature sensor<br><br><b>INSIDE REARVIEW MIRROR WITH THE AUTOMATIC DAY-NIGHT FEATURE SYSTEM OPERATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The inside rearview mirror uses 2 photocell sensors. One sensor is the headlight sensor, located on the face side of the mirror. The headlight sensor is used to determine light conditions present at the mirror face. The other sensor is the ambient light sensor, located on the rear of the mirror or windshield side. The ambient light sensor is used to determine the exterior light conditions. With a low exterior light condition detected, and a high light condition from behind of the car, at the headlight sensor, the inside rearview mirror will automatically darken the face of the mirror.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>In the daytime, the mirror is in a normal state because of the high exterior light condition that is indicated by the ambient light sensor. With the gear selector lever in the REVERSE position, backup lamp supply voltage is supplied as an input to the inside rearview mirror. The mirror monitors this input to disable the automatic day-night feature. This allows the driver to see objects in the mirror clearly when backing up, even during the night.<br><br><b>COMPASS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The mirror uses 2 magnetic field sensors for compass direction. One sensor is for north and south, the other is for east and west. The mirror supplies a signal and low reference to each sensor. As the vehicle travels with or against the earths magnetic pull, there will be a change in voltage on one or both sensors. As a result of the change in voltage, the mirror changes the heading on the compass display.<br><br><b>TEMPERATURE DISPLAY</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The inside rearview mirror monitors the ambient air temperature sensor. As the outside air temperature gets warmer, the ambient air temperature sensor will lower resistance. The inside rearview mirror monitors this change and will show this as a warmer temperature on the display. Temperatures exceeding <b>62&deg;C (143&deg;F)</b> will be out of the mirror's temperature range and SC will be shown on the temperature display. In colder outside air temperatures, the ambient air temperature sensor will raise in resistance. The inside rearview mirror will show a colder temperature on the display. Temperatures lower than <b>-40&deg;C (-40&deg;F)</b> will be out of the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Mirrors/">mirrors</a> temperature range which OC will be shown on the temperature display. In cold temperatures such as <b>3&deg;C (37&deg;F)</b> or below, the temperature display will show ICE when the ignition is first turned ON. The display will toggle between ICE and the actual outside temperature until the temperature update process is complete.<br><br><b>TEMPERATURE DISPLAY UPDATE PROCESS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The inside rearview mirror has a temperature program that takes in account the fact that the radiator will heat the ambient air temperature sensor if the radiator is warm and the vehicle is not moving. If the vehicle has been off for more than <b>2 hours</b>, the mirror temperature program assumes that the radiator has cooled and that the temperature supplied by the ambient air temperature sensor is accurate. Because of this, if the vehicle has been off for more than <b>2 hours</b>, the mirror displays the temperature as reported by the ambient air temperature sensor. When the ambient air temperature sensor reports a new temperature to the mirror, one of the following cases will apply:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition is OFF for more than <b>2 hours</b>, then is turned ON for more than <b>3 minutes</b>. The outside temperature is greater than the last temperature recorded by the mirror for <b>2 minutes</b>. The mirror will increase the last temperature reading by one degree every <b>2 minutes</b> for 8 consecutive times. If the outside temperature is not matched after the 8th update, the mirror will then display the current outside temperature.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition is off for more than <b>2 hours</b>, then is turned ON for less than <b>3 minutes</b>. The mirror will update the temperature display every <b>2 seconds</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition is OFF for more than <b>2 hours</b>, then is turned ON for more than <b>3 minutes</b>. The outside temperature is less than the last temperature recorded by the mirror. The mirror will then display the current outside temperature.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition has been OFF for less than <b>2 hours</b>. The outside temperature is greater than the last temperature recorded by the mirror, but the ignition is cycled from ON to OFF within <b>2 minutes</b>. The mirror will display the old temperature.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition has been OFF for less than <b>2 hours</b>. The outside temperature is less than the last temperature recorded by the mirror. The mirror will then display the current outside temperature.<br><br><b>SWITCHES OF THE INSIDE REARVIEW MIRROR WITH THE AUTOMATIC DAY-NIGHT FEATURE AND COMPASS WITHOUT ONSTAR(R)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The inside rearview mirror has 2 switches that perform the following functions:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The MIRROR switch is used to enable or disable the automatic day-night feature of the mirror. With the ignition in the ON position, depress the MIRROR switch to enable the automatic day-night feature of the mirror. A green indicator will illuminate on the mirror when the automatic day-night feature is enabled. To disable the automatic day-night feature of the mirror, depress the MIRROR switch.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The COMPASS switch is used to turn the compass ON and OFF. With the ignition in the ON position, depress the COMPASS switch to turn the compass ON. Depress the COMPASS switch again to turn the compass OFF. The COMPASS switch is also used to place the compass into a calibration or zone mode. For more information, refer to Compass Calibration and Magnetic Variance.<br><br><b>SWITCHES OF THE INSIDE REARVIEW MIRROR WITH THE AUTOMATIC DAY-NIGHT FEATURE, COMPASS/TEMPERATURE DISPLAY WITHOUT ONSTAR(R)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The inside rearview mirror has 2 switches that perform the following functions:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The TEMP switch is used to turn the compass/temperature display ON or OFF, it is also used to enable or disable the automatic day-night feature of the mirror.
