<h1>Video Entertainment System Troubleshooting Hints</h1><br><br><b>VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Many conditions that affect video system operation may be corrected without removing the radio, the digital video disc (DVD) player or the video entertainment overhead console from the vehicle. Make sure to understand all features of system operation before beginning the diagnosis of the system. Verify the condition and follow the diagnostic procedures in order to isolate and correct the condition.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Be sure the vehicle battery is fully charged before beginning video entertainment system diagnosis.<br><br><b>VIDEO OR AUDIO DISTORTION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The manufacturing process for producing DVDs does not have the same quality control processes in place that compact disk manufacturing does. If there are video or audio quality problems with an individual DVD, try playing that disk in another <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Accessories%2520and%2520Optional%2520Equipment/Entertainment%2520Systems/DVD%2520Player/index.html">DVD player</a>. If the quality is poor for both players, return the disk to the place of purchase and request an exchange. If the quality problem is only seen in one of the players, examine the disk for scratches dirt or smudges and attempt to clean the disk with one of the disk cleaning systems that are commercially available.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Video or audio distortion during auxiliary playback can often be attributed to the DC to AC inverter that is used to power the auxiliary device. The power inverters tend to introduce noisy signals into the vehicle electrical system.<br><br><b>VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM WIRELESS HEADPHONE INOPERATIVE</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  The following information lists the most probable cause of the concern to the least probable cause followed by the appropriate test for that condition.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Volume control on the wireless headphone set is turned all the way down.

Turn on power to the headphone set. If the headset indicator does not turn on, replace the batteries in the headset as needed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Faulty headphone set. Test the operation of the system using a known good headphone set. If operation is OK, replace the vehicle headphone set.<br><br><b>VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Accessories%2520and%2520Optional%2520Equipment/Radio%252C%2520Stereo%252C%2520and%2520Compact%2520Disc/Remote%2520Control/index.html">REMOTE CONTROL</a> INOPERATIVE</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The buttons on the video remote control do not operate the video disc player but the buttons on the video disc player operate normally.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  The following information lists the most probable cause of the concern to the least probable cause followed by the appropriate test for that condition.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Dead batteries in the video <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Accessories%2520and%2520Optional%2520Equipment/Radio%252C%2520Stereo%252C%2520and%2520Compact%2520Disc/Remote%2520Control/index.html">remote control</a>.

If the radio being serviced has this hole, proceed to step four. Otherwise the radio will need to be returned to your authorized Electronic Service Center for repair.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Push the "Eject" button. While the discs are attempting to eject, insert a plastic pen cap, or similar plastic object into the hole to assist the top disc out of the radio.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After the top disc is removed, push the "Eject" button again to remove the bottom disc.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check the operation of the radio to see if a CD or DVD can be inserted and then ejected.
