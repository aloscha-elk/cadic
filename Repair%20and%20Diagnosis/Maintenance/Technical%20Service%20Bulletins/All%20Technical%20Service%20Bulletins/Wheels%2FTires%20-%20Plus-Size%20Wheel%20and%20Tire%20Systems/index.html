Other new-style large utility vehicles such as the 2007 Avalanche, Tahoe, Yukon, Suburban and Yukon XL are NOT approved applications for the 22" wheel and TPC tire systems.<br><br>These GM approved applications include the unique control system calibrations for each vehicle, including anti-lock brake, electronic vehicle stability enhancement and speedometer calibrations.<br><br>GM strongly recommends AGAINST replacement of original equipment wheel and tire systems with other systems that use non-GM <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> or any wheels (including GM Accessories wheels) larger than specified by GM in approved applications, due to the following:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Wheel and tire systems are an integral part of a vehicle safety and performance system. Each GM Accessories wheel and TPC tire system is designed and released for the specified vehicle applications only.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Correct calibrations are required to maintain the intended performance of the vehicle systems.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Without proper integration of the wheel and tire system on a specific vehicle, larger wheel and tire systems may deliver:<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Decreased brake system performance<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Compromised vehicle handling and rollover resistance<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Changes in steering system performance<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Increased loads and stresses to the suspension, frame, and body that may decrease the life of vehicle components and systems<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Decreased ride performance<br><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-6'>&#09;</span>Compromised operations of anti-lock brakes, electronic stability control and tire pressure monitoring systems<br><br>Plus size wheel and tire systems may even cause changes in occupant protection or brake system performance that, as a result, may cause the vehicle to fail to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. For all these reasons, General Motors strongly recommends AGAINST the addition of plus-size wheel and tire systems on any vehicles for which these systems were not validated.<br><br>Additionally, non-approved installations or alterations to the original equipment vehicles as distributed by General Motors are not covered by the General Motors New Vehicle Limited Warranty. This warranty does not cover any damage or failure resulting from modification or alteration to the vehicle's original equipment as manufactured or assembled by General Motors except for dealer installed parts or accessories such as Delco radio or trailering hitch package, etc.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer</div>
