For this vehicle that is equipped with the engine off natural vacuum (EONV) diagnostic, the Service Bay Test uses the scan tool to initiate the control module's regular sequence of EVAP system DTC tests, but with different enable criteria. By using the Service Bay Test the I/M indicator can be set without the need for multiple cold soaks.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The scan tool displays for the Service Bay Test are based on the events that occur within the following three categories:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine running portion of the tests-The vehicle must remain at rest, in Park, or in Neutral, during this portion of the test. This test inspects for large leaks, a leaking purge valve and/or vent system restrictions. The scan tool will display test progress or the reason for an abort or failure.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drive cycle-The scan tool will display time and distance needed to warm the fuel.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition OFF-During this portion of the test, the engine controller will remain active for up to <b>45 minutes</b> when the ignition is turned OFF to allow control of the EVAP vent valve and run the EONV test. The engine controller inspects for small leaks during this period by monitoring <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a> pressure or vacuum. If the system is sealed, there will be a pressure or vacuum change. Pressure or vacuum changes that are less than the calibrated values indicate a leak.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Emission%20Control%20Systems/Evaporative%20Emissions%20System/Evaporative%20Emission%20Control%20Canister/">EVAP</a> diagnostics are initiated by the Service Bay Test, the scan tool will indicate if the enable conditions listed below are not met, or will display a specific reason if the test aborts.
