<h1>Wipers/Washers - Windshield Wiper Performance Information</h1><b>INFORMATION</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.:</b> 06-08-43-003D<br><br><b>Date:</b> February 12, 2013<br><br><b>Subject:</b> Windshield Wiper Performance, Cleaning Instructions and Maintenance<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2014 and Prior GM Passenger Cars and Trucks <br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to add the 2013 and 2014 model years and update the glass cleaner part number. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 06-08-43-003C (Section 08 - Body and Accessories).<br><br><b>Wiper Concerns</b><br><br>Most concerns about windshield wiper performance are the result of dirty <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Blade/index.html">wiper blades</a>, damaged wiper blades, or worn out blades that are continuing to be used beyond their useful life. Depending on environmental conditions, wiper blades can have dramatic differences in lifespan. Here are some tips and guidelines to maximize wiper performance to avoid damage to the blades, and to avoid unnecessary replacements.<br><br>Many <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Blade/index.html">wiper blades</a> are being replaced under warranty with reviews showing there is nothing wrong with the returned blades other than a build-up of dirt. Additionally, advise the customer to review the information in their Owner Manual.<br><br><b>Inspection and Cleaning</b><br><br><b>Scheduled Maintenance</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect your wipers rubber blades every 4-6 months or 12,000 km (7,500 mi) for wear, cracking or contamination.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Clean the windshield and the rubber <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Blade/index.html">wiper blades</a> (using the procedure below) if the blades are not clearing the glass satisfactorily. If this does not correct the problem, then replace the rubber elements.<br><br><b>Cleaning Procedure</b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Avoid getting windshield washer fluid on your hands. Wear rubber gloves or avoid direct contact with washer fluid.</b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Do not use gasoline, kerosene, or petroleum based products to clean <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Blade/index.html">wiper blades</a>.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Clean the rubber blades using a lint free cloth or paper towel soaked with windshield washer fluid or a mild detergent. You should see significant amounts of dirt being removed on the cloth.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Be sure to wash the windshield thoroughly when you clean the blades. Bugs, road grime, sap and a buildup of car wash/wax treatments may additionally cause wiper streaking.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Tip</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For a larger scale buildup on the windshield, use a non-abrasive cleaner such as Bon-Ami* (www.faultless.com) cleanser with a wet sponge, being sure to use plenty of water to avoid scratching the glass. Flush the surface and body panels completely.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Tip</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For day-to-day exterior glass cleaning and to maintain a streak free appearance, suggest Vehicle Care Glass Cleaner, P/N 19287404 (18 oz) or 19259280 (6 oz) (in Canada, 88865156). This product is an easy to use foaming cleaner that quickly removes dirt and grime from glass surfaces.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Tip</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Interior glass should be cleaned with plain, clean water to eliminate any film or haze on the window and help prevent fogging, a major customer dissatisfier. Refer to the latest version of Corporate Bulletin Number 03-00-89-006 for more information. The New Vehicle Pre-Delivery Inspection form also recommends using plain water to clean interior glass.<br><br>*We believe this material to be reliable.

Some of these you can control and others are environmental concerns.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Extremely dusty areas (such as driving on dirt roads) may cause the wipers rubber edge to wear quickly and unevenly.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Sand and salt used on roads for increasing winter traction and ice control will cause the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Blade/index.html">wiper blades</a> to wear quicker. Areas with significant snowfall require more frequent blade replacements.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Heat and time may cause the rubber blades to take a "permanent set" resulting in the rubber not flexing and turning over uniformly. This condition may result in streaking and/or unwiped areas.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Rubber blades are easily cut or torn when using ice scrapers. Likewise pulling blades up off a frozen windshield can tear the rubber. Exercise caution when clearing ice and snow.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Using your wipers to "wear through" frost and ice, instead of allowing the defrosters to melt the ice, can dull, nick or tear the rubber blades.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Banging wipers on the glass to remove ice and snow may cause the blade to bend, dislodging the rubber and causing potential scratching of the windshield.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ice can form in the pin joints of the wipers, which can cause streaking and unwiped areas. To remove ice from pin joints, compress the blade and rubber edge with your hand to loosen the frozen joints. Consider using <b>Winter Blades</b> that have a rubber cover to avoid this condition.<br><br><b>Note</b><br>GM does not recommend the use of any spray on/wipe on windshield treatments or washer fluid additives. The variation in friction that results on the glass from the use of these products causes wipers to chatter and have premature wear.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br></div>
