Verify that the PCV system is functioning properly. If the customer understands that some oil consumption is normal and still feels the consumption level is excessive, more than 1 quart per 2000 to 3000 miles of driving, perform the service indicated in this bulletin. It is no longer necessary to have the customer return multiple times to have the usage verified.<br><br><b>Cause</b><br><br>This condition may be caused by two conditions. Oil pulled through the PCV system or oil spray that is discharged from the AFM pressure relief valve within the crankcase. Under most driving conditions and drive cycles, the discharged oil does not cause a problem. Under certain drive cycles (extended high engine speed operation), in combination with parts at the high end of their tolerance specification, the oil spray quantity may be more than usual, resulting in excessive deposit formation in the <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Engine%252C%2520Cooling%2520and%2520Exhaust/Engine/Cylinder%2520Block%2520Assembly/Piston%2520Ring/index.html">piston ring</a> grooves, causing increased oil consumption and cracked or fouled <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Tune-up%2520and%2520Engine%2520Performance%2520Checks/Spark%2520Plug/index.html">spark plugs</a> (#1 and/or #7).
