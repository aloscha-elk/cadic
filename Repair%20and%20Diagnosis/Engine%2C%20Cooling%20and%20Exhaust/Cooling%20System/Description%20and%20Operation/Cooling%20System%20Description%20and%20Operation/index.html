<h1>Cooling System Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">Cooling System</a> Description and Operation</b><br><br><b>Engine Coolant Indicators </b><br><br><b>ENGINE COOLANT HOT</b><br><br>The instrument panel cluster (IPC) displays ENGINE COOLANT HOT message when the IPC receives a class 2 message from the powertrain control module (PCM) requesting illumination of this driver warning.<br><br><b>ENGINE OVERHEATED</b><br><br>The IPC displays ENGINE OVERHEATED message when the IPC receives a class 2 message from the PCM requesting illumination of this driver warning.<br><br><b>LOW COOLANT LEVEL </b><br><br>The IPC displays LOW COOLANT LEVEL message when the IPC receives a class 2 message from the PCM requesting illumination of this driver warning.<br><br><b>REDUCED ENGINE POWER</b><br><br>The IPC displays REDUCED ENGINE POWER message when the IPC detects a reduced engine power condition from the PCM. The IPC receives a class 2 message from the PCM requesting illumination when the engine temperature reaches 132&deg;C (270&deg;F).<br><br><b>Cooling Fan Control - Two Fan System</b><br><br>The engine cooling fan system consists of 2 electrical cooling fans and 3 fan relays. The relays are arranged in a series/parallel configuration that allows the powertrain control module (PCM) to operate both fans together at low or high speeds. The cooling fans and fan relays receive battery positive voltage from the underhood fuse block. <br><br>During low speed operation, the PCM supplies the ground path for the low speed fan relay through the low speed cooling fan relay control circuit. This energizes the low speed fan relay coil, closes the relay contacts, and supplies battery positive voltage from the low fan fuse through the cooling fan motor supply voltage circuit to the left cooling fan. The ground path for the left cooling fan is through the cooling fan s/p relay and the right cooling fan. The result is a series circuit with both fans running at low speed.<br><br>During high speed operation the PCM supplies the ground path for the low speed fan relay through the low speed cooling fan relay control circuit. After a 3 second delay, the PCM supplies a ground path for the high speed fan relay and the cooling fan s/p relay through the high speed cooling fan relay control circuit. This energizes the cooling fan s/p relay coil, closes the relay contacts, and provides a ground path for the left cooling fan. At the same time the high speed fan relay coil is energized closing the relay contacts and provides battery positive voltage from the high fan fuse on the cooling fan motor supply voltage circuit to the right cooling fan. During high speed fan operation, both engine cooling fans have there own ground path. The result is a parallel circuit with both fans running at high speed.<br><br><b>Important:</b> <b>The right and left cooling fan connectors are interchangeable. When servicing the fans be sure that the connectors are plugged into the correct fan.</b><br><br>The PCM commands the low speed cooling fans ON under the following conditions:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine coolant temperature <b>exceeds approximately 94.5&deg;C (202&deg;F).</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A/C refrigerant pressure <b>exceeds 1447 kPa (210 psi).</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After the vehicle is shut OFF if the engine coolant temperature at key-off is <b>greater than 101&deg;C (214&deg;F)</b> the low speed fans will run for a <b>minimum of 60 seconds After 60 seconds,</b> if the coolant temperature drops <b>below 101&deg;C (214&deg;F)</b> the fans will shut OFF. The fans will automatically shut OFF after <b>3 min.</b> regardless of coolant temperature.<br><br>The PCM commands the high speed fans ON under the following conditions:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine coolant temperature <b>exceeds approximately 104.25&deg;C (220&deg;F).</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A/C refrigerant pressure exceeds <b>approximately 1824 kPa (265 psi).</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>When certain DTCs set.<br><br>At idle and very low vehicle speeds the cooling fans are only allowed to increase in speed if required. This insures idle stability by preventing the fans from cycling between high and low speed.<br><br><b>Coolant Level Control (If Equipped)</b><br><br>The engine <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">cooling system</a> contains an engine coolant level switch to alert the driver in the event of a coolant loss. The powertrain control module (PCM) sends out a coolant loss signal over the coolant level switch signal circuit. When the engine coolant level switch reads a low coolant level in the fill tank, the switch opens. The message center receives its power from engine wiring harness junction block on the battery positive voltage circuit. Ground is provided by the ground circuits via the body wiring harness junction block and the engine wiring harness junction block. The cluster receives the class 2 message from the PCM indicating Low Coolant and displays the LOW COOLANT LEVEL message on the driver information center (DIC).<br><br><b>Coolant Heater</b><br><br>The optional engine coolant heater (RPO K05) operates using <b>110-volt</b> AC external power and is designed to warm the coolant in the engine block area for improved starting in very cold weather <b>29&deg;C (20&deg;F).</b> The coolant heater helps reduce fuel consumption when a cold engine is warming up. The unit is equipped with a detachable AC power cord. A weather shield on the cord is provided to protect the plug when not in use.<br><br></div>
