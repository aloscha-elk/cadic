This condition may be most noticeable when the converter clutch is engaged. It is similar to the feel of towing a trailer.<br><br>Delayed<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A condition where a shift is expected but does not occur for a period of time. This could be described as a clutch or band engagement that does not occur as quickly as expected during a part throttle or wide open throttle apply of the accelerator, or during manual downshifting to a lower range. This term is also defined as LATE or EXTENDED.<br><br>Double Bump (Double Feel)<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Two sudden and forceful applies of a clutch or a band.<br><br>Early<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A condition where the shift occurs before the car has reached proper speed. This condition tends to labor the engine after the upshift.<br><br>End Bump<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A firmer feel at the end of a shift than at the start of the shift. This is also defined as END FEEL or SLIP BUMP.<br><br>Firm<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A noticeably quick apply of a clutch or band that is considered normal with a medium to heavy throttle. This apply should not be confused with HARSH or ROUGH.<br><br>Flare<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A quick increase in engine RPM along with a momentary loss of torque. This most generally occurs during a shift. This condition is also defined as SLIPPING.<br><br>Harsh (Rough)<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A more noticeable apply of a clutch or band than FIRM. This condition is considered undesirable at any throttle position.<br><br>Hunting<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A repeating quick series of upshifts and downshifts that causes a noticeable change in engine RPM, such as a 4-3-4 shift pattern. This condition is also defined as BUSYNESS.<br><br>Initial Feel<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A distinctly firmer feel at the start of a shift than at the finish of the shift.<br><br>Late<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A shift that occurs when the engine RPM is higher than normal for a given amount of throttle.<br><br>Shudder<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A repeating jerking condition similar to CHUGGLE but more severe and rapid. This condition may be most noticeable during certain ranges of vehicle speed.<br><br>Slipping<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A noticeable increase in engine RPM without a vehicle speed increase. A slip usually occurs during or after initial clutch or band apply.<br><br>Soft<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A slow, almost unnoticeable clutch or band apply with very little shift feel.<br><br>Surge<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A repeating engine related condition of acceleration and deceleration that is less intense than CHUGGLE.<br><br>Tie-Up<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A condition where two opposing clutch and/or bands are attempting to apply at the same time causing the engine to labor with a noticeable loss of engine RPM.<br><br><b>Noise Conditions</b><br><br>Drive Link Noise<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A whine or growl that increases or fades with vehicle speed, and is most noticeable under a light throttle acceleration. It may also be noticeable in PARK or NEUTRAL operating ranges with the vehicle stationary.<br><br>Final Drive Noise<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A hum related to vehicle speed which is most noticeable under a light throttle acceleration.<br><br>Planetary Gear Noise<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A whine related to vehicle speed, which is most noticeable in FIRST gear, SECOND gear, FOURTH gear or REVERSE. The condition may become less noticeable, or go away, after an upshift.<br><br>Pump Noise<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A high pitched whine that increases in intensity with engine RPM. This condition may also be noticeable in all operating ranges with the vehicle stationary or moving.<br><br>Torque Converter Noise<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A whine usually noticed when a vehicle is stopped, and the transmission is in DRIVE or REVERSE. The noise will increase with engine RPM.<br><br><b>Transmission Abbreviations</b><br><br>A/C<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Air Conditioning<br><br>AC<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Alternating Current<br><br>AT<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Automatic Transmission<br><br>DC<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Direct Current<br><br>DIC<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Driver Information Center<br><br>DLC<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Diagnostic Link Connector<br><br>DMM<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Digital Multimeter<br><br>DTC<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Diagnostic Trouble Code<br><br>ECT<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine Coolant Temperature<br><br>EMI<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Electromagnetic Interference<br><br>IAT<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Intake Air Temperature<br><br>IGN<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition<br><br>IPC<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Instrument Panel Cluster<br><br>ISS<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Input Speed Sensor<br><br>MAP<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Manifold Absolute Pressure<br><br>MIL<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Malfunction Indicator Lamp<br><br>NC<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Normally Closed<br><br>NO<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Normally Open<br><br>OBD<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>On Board Diagnostic<br><br>OSS<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Output (Shaft) <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Transmission%2520Control%2520Systems/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Transfer%2520Case/Speed%2520Sensor/index.html">Speed Sensor</a><br><br>PC<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pressure Control<br><br>PCM<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Powertrain Control Module<br><br>PWM<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pulse Width Modulation<br><br>RPM<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Revolutions Per Minute<br><br>SS<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Shift Solenoid<br><br>TAP<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Transmission Adaptive Pressure<br><br>TCC<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Torque Converter Clutch<br><br><a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Transmission%2520Control%2520Systems/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520A%252FT/Control%2520Module/index.html">TCM</a><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Transmission Control Module<br><br>TFP<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Transmission Fluid Pressure<br><br>TFT<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Transmission Fluid Temperature<br><br>TP<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Throttle Position<br><br>TV<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Throttle Valve<br><br>VSS<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vehicle Speed Sensor<br><br>WOT<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wide Open Throttle<br><br>4WD<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Four-Wheel Drive<br><br></div>
