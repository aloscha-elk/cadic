If the CCA and RC are higher, then the battery run down time would be longer. If the CCA and RC are lower, then the battery run down time would be shorter. The graph below indicates roughly how many days a 690 CCA battery with at 110 min. RC (60.5 AH) starting at <b>80 percent</b> state of charge will last with a constant current draw until it reaches <b>50 percent</b> state of charge.

Turn the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Starting%20and%20Charging/Starting%20System/Ignition%20Switch/">ignition switch</a> to the OFF position and remove the ignition switch <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Starting%2520and%2520Charging/Starting%2520System/Key/index.html">key</a>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connect a <b>10A</b> fused jumper wire to the test switch tool terminals.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the J 38758 knob to the OFF position.

Check and record the current reading.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>When there is a current reading of <b>2A</b> or less, turn the J 38758 knob to the ON position. The electrical current will now pass through the switch.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Then switch the digital multimeter down to the <b>2A</b> scale for a more accurate reading when the J 38758 knob is turned OFF.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>16.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn the J 38758 knob to the OFF position. Wait <b>15 minutes</b> for most vehicles.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>17.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check and record the current reading.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>18.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Note the battery reserve capacity, amp hour rating. Refer to Battery Usage.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Divide the reserve capacity by <b>4, amp</b> hour rating by 2.4.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Compare this to the multimeter milliampere reading taken in the previous step. The parasitic current drain should not exceed this number. Example: If a battery has a reserve capacity of <b>100 minutes</b>, (60 A/H) the current drain should not exceed <b>25 mA</b>.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>19.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If excessive current drain is not found at this time and there are no other apparent causes, complete the following:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Using the MIN/MAX function of the digital multimeter, monitor the parasitic drain overnight or during the day. This will determine if something has been activated during that time frame.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b> The test switch must be in the ON position when removing the fuses in order to maintain continuity in the electrical system. This avoids damaging the digital multimeter due to accidental overloading, such as a door being opened to change a fuse.<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  Removing fuses, relays, and connectors to determine the failure area may wake up modules. You must wait for these modules to go to sleep or use the sleep function on the scan tool.<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>When the vehicle has an unacceptable amount of parasitic current drain, remove each fuse one at a time until the current drain falls to an acceptable level. This will indicate which circuit is causing the drain. Refer to Power Distribution Schematics to diagnose exactly which part of the suspect circuit is causing the parasitic drain. In some cases a non-fused circuit or component, such as a relay, is the cause of excessive parasitic current drain.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Repeat the parasitic current drain test procedure after any repair has been completed to make sure that the parasitic current drain is at an acceptable level.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>When the cause of the excessive current drain has been located and repaired, remove the J 38758.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>20.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connect the battery negative cable to the battery negative terminal.</div>
