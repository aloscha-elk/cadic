The control module determines the internal mechanical condition of the engine through the actual measured values of the mass airflow (MAF) sensor, the intake manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor, and the throttle position (TP) sensor. The actual measured values of the 3 sensors are then compared to the calculated values for V4 mode, stored in the engine control module (ECM). If the measured values are incorrect for V4 mode, the ECM will set DTC P3400, and will return to V8 mode operation.<br><br><b>CONDITIONS FOR RUNNING THE DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTCs P0102, P0103, P0107, P0108, P0112, P0113, P0117, P0119, P0335, and P0336 are not set.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine speed is between <b>450-6,400 RPM</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The IAT Sensor parameter is between <b>-7 and +125&deg;C (+19 and +257&deg;F)</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ECT Sensor parameter is between <b>70- 125&deg;C (158-257&deg;F)</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Time in V8 mode is more than <b>2 seconds</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Time in V4 mode is more than <b>2 seconds</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>This DTC runs continuously within the enabling conditions.<br><br><b>CONDITIONS FOR SETTING THE DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The control module detects that the actual measured values from the MAF sensor, MAP sensor, and TP sensor, is not within the range of the calculated values for V4 mode.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The above condition is met for more than <b>100 milliseconds</b>.<br><br><b>ACTION TAKEN WHEN THE DTC SETS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTC P3400 is a Type B DTC.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine will return to V8 mode.<br><br><b>CONDITIONS FOR CLEARING THE DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>DTC P3400 is a Type B DTC.<br><br><b>DIAGNOSTIC AIDS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>This DTC will not set during engine idling conditions.
