<h1>Memory Seats Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>MEMORY SEATS DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION</b><br><br>Battery voltage is supplied to the driver seat module through a <b>25 A </b>circuit breaker. The driver seat module supplies the seat adjuster switch assembly with a battery positive reference voltage. While the seat adjuster switches are in an inactive state the switch contacts are closed to the adjuster switch common circuit. When a seat adjuster switch is pressed to an active state the switch contact is closed to the reference voltage circuit. Battery voltage on a switch signal circuit indicates to the driver seat module the switch status is active. Each seat adjuster motor is controlled by the driver seat module through 2 motor control circuits. While the seat adjuster motors are in an inactive state the motor control circuits are closed to ground circuit contacts within the driver seat module. The driver seat module operates the seat adjuster motors by switching one of a motors control circuits to battery voltage. The seat adjuster motors are bidirectional and the direction of adjuster motor rotation is determined by which of the adjuster motor control circuits is switched to battery voltage while the other remains grounded.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Memory Set/Recall Operation</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The seat adjuster motors are equipped with internal position sensors. The adjuster motor position sensors are monitored by the driver seat module and are used to determine the seat position when storing or recalling memory settings. The driver seat adjuster motors use potentiometer type position sensors. The position sensors are supplied with a <b>5-volt</b> positive reference and ground circuits from the driver seat module. The position sensor signal circuits return to an analog input within the driver seat module. During adjuster motor operation the position sensor provides a voltage change proportional to the change in revolution of the adjuster motor shaft. The driver seat module monitors the voltage from the position sensor signal circuits to determine the adjuster motor positions when storing or recalling memory seat position settings. to.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The memory recall switch assembly on the driver door provides inputs to the driver door module. Battery voltage is supplied to the memory recall switch assembly from the driver door module. When a RCL 1, RCL 2, or EXIT switch is pressed, the switch contacts close the appropriate switch signal circuit to the battery voltage supply circuit within the memory recall switch assembly. When the driver door module receives active switch signals from the memory recall switch assembly, the appropriate commands are sent to the driver seat module using the GMLAN Serial Data circuit.

The transmission selector lever position data is provided to the driver seat module by a message through the GMLAN Serial Data circuit.</div>
