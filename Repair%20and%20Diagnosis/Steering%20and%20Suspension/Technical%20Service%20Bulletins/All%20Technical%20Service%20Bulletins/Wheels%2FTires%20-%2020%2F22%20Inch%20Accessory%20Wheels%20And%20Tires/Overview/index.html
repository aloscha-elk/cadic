Also, the vehicle should not be driven aggressively (hard acceleration or braking) for the first 24 hours after tire mounting to allow the lubricant to dry. Failure to do so may cause the tire to slip on the rim. This condition will affect wheel balance which could result in a vibration. Refer to Corporate Bulletin Number 08-03-10-004 for additional information.<br><br>Tire Label<br><br><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>All 20" tire and wheel packs are shipped with two different tire labels. Use tire label P/N 19165889 (road tire pressure of 32 psi) for the models listed in this bulletin. <br><br>After installing the recommended <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a>, place the provided tire label on the vehicle. The new tire label should be located within the red box, over the top of the original tire label found on the door jamb. To locate the label within the red box use the upper left hand edge of the red line as a guide. When properly placed, the new tire label will obscure the original tire information. Be sure that the surface is clean and dry. The surface temperature should not be less than 21&deg;C (65&deg;F). The label is provided as a guide for tire inflation pressures and information relevant to occupant/cargo capacities.<br><br>Tire Type/Pressure Selection<br><br>To provide a more accurate function of the Tire Pressure Monitoring System, it is necessary to update the Remote Control Door Lock Receiver (RCDLR) with the correct tire type and pressure information. Using the Tech 2(R), follow the steps listed below to select the appropriate tire type/pressure:<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Install the scan tool.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn ignition ON with engine OFF.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Enter "Diagnostics" and build vehicle according to model year, vehicle line, etc.<br><br>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select "Body".<br><br>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select "RCDLR Module".<br><br>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select F2: Module Setup.<br><br>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select F5: Tire Type/Pressure Selection.<br><br>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select P-Metric Standard.<br><br>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select the front and rear tire pressure as noted on the new vehicle driver door placard sticker for the accessory <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a>/<a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a>. <br><br>10.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that the selections made are correct and press the enter key.

Replacement sensors can be obtained or sensors from the OE wheels can be transferred to the accessory wheels. After the wheels are installed on the vehicle, it is necessary to learn the new sensor identification codes/locations into the remote control door lock receiver (RCDLR).<br><br>TPM Sensor Relearn Procedure<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Before proceeding, ensure that no other learn procedure is being performed simultaneously or that tire pressures are not being adjusted on another TPM equipped vehicle within close proximity. Stray signals from other TPM equipped vehicles just driving by can be inadvertently learned. If any random horn chirps are heard from the vehicle while performing the learn procedure, most likely a stray sensor has been learned and the procedure will need to be cancelled and repeated. Under these circumstances, performing the TPM Learn Procedure away from other vehicles would be highly recommended. In the event a particular sensor pressure increase/decrease activation does not cause the horn to chirp, it may be necessary to rotate the wheel valve stem to a different position due to the sensor signal is being blocked by another component.<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Place the ignition switch in the proper position as follows: <br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>With standard ignition switch, place the switch in the RUN position. <br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>With electronic keyless ignition, place the switch in the ACCY position.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Initiate the TPM Learn Mode using one of the following procedures:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Using a scan tool, initiate the TPM Learn Mode. A double horn chirp will sound indicating the Learn Mode has been enabled. The left front turn signal will also be illuminated.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>On vehicles equipped with keyless entry, simultaneously press the keyless entry transmitters lock and unlock buttons until a double horn chirp sounds indicating the Learn Mode has been enabled. The left front turn signal will also be illuminated.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>On vehicles not equipped with keyless entry, press and release the driver information center (DIC) INFO button until the RELEARN TIRE POSITIONS message appears on the DIC display. Press and hold the SET/RESET button until a double horn chirp sounds and the DIC displays a TIRE LEARNING ACTIVE message indicating the Learn Mode has been enabled. The left front turn signal will also be illuminated.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Starting with the left front tire, learn the tire pressure using one of the following methods:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Hold the antenna of the J 46079 aimed upward against the tire sidewall close to the wheel rim at the valve stem location. Press and release the activate button and wait for a horn chirp. Once the horn chirp has sounded, the turn signal in the next location to be learned will illuminate.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Keyless entry or DIC learn mode enable method only - Increase/decrease the tire pressure for 8-10 seconds then wait for a horn chirp. The horn chirp may occur before or up to 30 seconds after the 8-10 second pressure increase/decrease time period has been reached. Once the horn chirp has sounded, the turn signal in the next location to be learned will illuminate.<br><br>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After the horn chirp has sounded and the right front turn signal is illuminated, repeat step 3 for the remaining 3 sensors in the following order:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-10'>&#09;</span>Right front<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-10'>&#09;</span>Right rear<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-10'>&#09;</span>Left rear<br><br>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After the LR sensor has been learned, a double horn chirp will sound indicating all sensors have been learned.<br><br>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn OFF the ignition to exit the learn mode.<br><br>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After the learn mode has been exited, adjust all <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> to the recommended pressures indicated on the new tire label.<br><br><a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/Spare%2520Tire/index.html">Spare Tire</a> Hoist (22" <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">Wheels</a> Only)<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The new <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Tires/Spare%2520Tire/index.html">spare tire</a> hoist is necessary due to the added amount of stress that the 22" wheel/tire system causes to the factory installed tire hoist.
