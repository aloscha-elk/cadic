As the wheel spins, the wheel speed sensor produces a square wave DC signal voltage. The wheel speed sensor increases the signal frequency as the wheel speed increases, but does not increase the signal amplitude.<br><br><b>Antilock Brake System (ABS) Operation</b><br><br>When wheel slip is detected during a brake application, an antilock brake system (ABS) event occurs. During antilock braking, hydraulic pressure in the individual wheel circuits is controlled to prevent any wheel from slipping. A separate hydraulic line and specific solenoid valves are provided for each wheel. The ABS can decrease, hold, or increase hydraulic pressure to each wheel. The ABS does not, however, increase hydraulic pressure above the amount which is transmitted by the master cylinder during braking. <br><br>During antilock braking, a series of rapid pulsations is felt in the brake pedal. These pulsations are caused by the rapid changes in position of the individual solenoid valves as the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Brakes%2520and%2520Traction%2520Control/Electronic%2520Brake%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">electronic brake control module</a> (EBCM) responds to <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Brakes%2520and%2520Traction%2520Control/Wheel%2520Speed%2520Sensor/index.html">wheel speed sensor</a> inputs and attempts to prevent wheel slip. These pedal pulsations are present only during antilock braking and stop when normal braking is resumed or when the vehicle comes to a stop. A ticking or popping noise may also be heard as the solenoid valves cycle rapidly. During antilock braking on dry pavement, intermittent chirping noises may be heard as the tires approach slipping. These noises and pedal pulsations are considered normal during antilock operation.<br><br>Vehicles equipped with ABS may be stopped by applying normal force to the brake pedal. Brake pedal operation during normal braking is no different than that of previous non-ABS systems. Maintaining a constant force on the brake pedal provides the shortest stopping distance while maintaining vehicle stability. The typical ABS activation sequence is as follows.<br><br><b>Pressure Hold</b><br><br>The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Brakes%2520and%2520Traction%2520Control/Electronic%2520Brake%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">EBCM</a> closes the isolation valve and keeps the dump valve closed in order to isolate the slipping wheel when wheel slip occurs. This holds the pressure steady on the brake so that the hydraulic pressure does not increase or decrease.<br><br><b>Pressure Decrease</b><br><br>If a pressure hold does not correct the wheel slip condition, a pressure decrease occurs. The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Brakes%2520and%2520Traction%2520Control/Electronic%2520Brake%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">EBCM</a> decreases the pressure to individual wheels during deceleration when wheel slip occurs. The isolation valve is closed and the dump valve is opened. The excess fluid is stored in the accumulator until the pump can return the fluid to the master cylinder or fluid reservoir.<br><br><b>Pressure Increase</b><br><br>After the wheel slip is corrected, a pressure increase occurs. The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Brakes%2520and%2520Traction%2520Control/Electronic%2520Brake%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">EBCM</a> increases the pressure to individual wheels during deceleration in order to reduce the speed of the wheel. The isolation valve is opened and the dump valve is closed. The increased pressure is delivered from the master cylinder.<br><br><b>Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD) Operation</b><br><br>The electronic brake distribution (EBD) is a control system that replaces the hydraulic proportioning function of the mechanical proportioning valve in the base brake system. The EBD control system is part of the operation software in the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Brakes%2520and%2520Traction%2520Control/Electronic%2520Brake%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">electronic brake control module</a> (EBCM).

However, certain failures cannot be detected unless active diagnostic tests are performed on the components. Shorted solenoid coil or motor windings, for example, cannot be detected until the components are commanded ON by the EBCM. Therefore, a power-up self-test is required at the beginning of each ignition cycle to verify correct operation of components before the various control systems can be enabled. The EBCM performs the power-up self-test when the ignition is first turned ON. The system relay, solenoids and the antilock brake system (ABS) pump motor are commanded ON and OFF to verify proper operation and the EBCM verifies the ability to return the system to base braking in the event of a failure. The power-up self-test may be heard by the driver, depending on how soon the engine is cranked and started after turning ON the ignition.<br><br><b>ECE 13 Response</b><br><br>The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Brakes%2520and%2520Traction%2520Control/Electronic%2520Brake%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">electronic brake control module</a> (EBCM) illuminates the antilock brake system (ABS) indicator when a malfunction which disables ABS is detected.

This allows the EBCM to verify that no malfunction exists, before turning OFF the ABS indicator.
