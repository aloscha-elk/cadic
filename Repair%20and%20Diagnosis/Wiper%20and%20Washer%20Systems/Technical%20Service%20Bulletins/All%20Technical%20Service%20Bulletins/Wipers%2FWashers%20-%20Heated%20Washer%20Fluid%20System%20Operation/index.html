<h1>Wipers/Washers - Heated Washer Fluid System Operation</h1>Bulletin No.: 07-08-43-009<br><br>Date: August 14, 2007<br><br>INFORMATION<br><br>Subject:<br>Heated Windshield Washer Fluid System Operation - Unwanted Activation of the Front Windshield Washers<br><br>Models:<br>2007-2008 Cadillac Escalade, Escalade ESV, Escalade EXT<br>2007-2008 Chevrolet Avalanche, Silverado, Suburban, Tahoe<br>2007-2008 GMC Sierra, Yukon, Yukon Denali, Yukon XL, Yukon Denali XL<br><br>with Heated Windshield Washer Fluid System (RPO XA7)<br><br>The purpose of this bulletin is to further explain information found in SI and the Owner's Manual about the operation of the Heated Windshield Washer Fluid System.<br><br>Operation:<br><br>Push the heated washer fluid button to activate the heated windshield washer fluid system. This activation begins four heated wash/wipe cycles. The first heated wash/wipe cycle can take up to 40 seconds to occur, depending on outside temperature. After the first wash/wipe cycle, it can take up to 20 seconds for each of the remaining cycles. To end the heated windshield washer/wipe cycle early press the button again to turn off the heated windshield washer fluid system or it will automatically turn off after four wipe cycles have been completed.<br><br>Diagnostic Tips:<br><br>If a customer comes in with a comment about unwanted activation of the front windshield washers, first verify that the heated washer fluid switch was not pressed. Some customers may be unknowingly turning on the heated windshield washers. The heated windshield washer button is located below the HVAC controls and if personal items are placed on the center console, it is possible to inadvertently activate the heated washers.<br><br>If the switch was not pressed and the washers/wipers continue to cycle with no switch input, observe the Wiper/Washer data using the Tech 2(R). When the concern is happening, it will display the "<a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Windshield%2520Washer%2520Switch/index.html">Windshield Washer Switch</a>" as active even though the switch is not being pressed. This may be caused by an intermittent short in the heated washer fluid module.<br><br>It has been found, during part reviews of the heated windshield washer module at the Warranty Parts Center (WPC), that a large number of parts returned are no trouble found (NTF). Some of these NTF returns may be due to mis-diagnosis or from customers not fully understanding how the heated windshield washer fluid system operates.<br><br>The information in this bulletin is being provided to help reduce the NTF returns.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br></div>
