<h1>Seats - Driver/Passenger Heated Seats Inop./Slow to Warm</h1><b>TECHNICAL</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.: </b>10-08-50-008B<br><br><b>Date: </b>January 13, 2011<br><br><b>Subject: </b>Driver or Passenger Heated Seat Inoperative, Slow to Warm, DTC(s) Set (Repair Connector, Re-Route Harness)<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2007-2010 Cadillac Escalade, Escalade ESV, Escalade EXT<br>2007-2010 Chevrolet Silverado, Suburban, Tahoe<br>2011 Chevrolet Silverado Heavy Duty<br>2007-2010 GMC Sierra, Yukon, Yukon XL, Yukon Denali, Yukon Denali XL<br>2011 GMC Sierra Heavy Duty<br>All Equipped with Heated Front Seat (RPO AN3, KA1) or Heated and Cooled Seat (RPO KB6) and/or Luxury Package (RPO PCK)<br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to update the RPOs. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 10-08-50-008A (Section 08 - Body and Accessories). <br><br><b>Condition</b><br><br>Some customers may comment that the driver or passenger heated seat system exhibits the following symptoms:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Heated seat turns on and then turns off within 1 to 10 minutes (at any 60 second interval).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The system doesn't get warm enough, or gets warm very slowly.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The heated seat system is completely inoperative.<br><br>Upon further review, DTCs B2430 0D and/or B2180 0D may be set as a current or history code if the vehicle is equipped with heated seats only (RPO KA1). Also, the LED indicator for the heated seats may come On and then flash after approximately 1 minute, then go out.<br><br>If the vehicle is equipped with heated and cooled seats (KB6), the switch LED indicator may stay On, but the heated and cooled seat is inoperative. The fan will continue to blow air.<br><br><b>Cause</b><br><br><b>Heated Seats (RPO AN3, KA1)</b><br><br>The heated seat control circuit terminal and/or ground terminal in harness connector X1 to the memory seat module (MSM) may have lost tension and is loose. The reduced terminal tension increases resistance in the connector, which may result in the symptoms described above.<br><br><b>Heated and Cooled Seats (RPO KB6)</b><br><br>The thermo-electric device (TED) in the seat cushion/seat back ventilation heating and cooling module may have become inoperative. <br><br><b>Correction</b><br><br><b>Heated Seats (RPO AN3, KA1)</b><br><br>Follow the steps below to correct the concern with the heated seats.<br><br><b>Note</b><br>This repair requires a unique anti-abrasion electrical tape and harness clip from Kent Automotive.
