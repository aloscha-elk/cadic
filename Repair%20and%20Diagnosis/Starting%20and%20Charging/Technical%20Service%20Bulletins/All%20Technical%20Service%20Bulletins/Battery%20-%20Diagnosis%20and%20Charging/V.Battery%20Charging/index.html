<h1>V.Battery Charging</h1><span class='indent-0'>&#09;</span>Dealership service personnel are advised to refer to Cadillac Serviceman Bulletin T-83-12, Group 6D for detailed instructions on:<br><br><span class='indent-0'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Battery Side Terminal Connections<br><span class='indent-0'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Battery Charging<br><span class='indent-0'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Charging Time Required<br><span class='indent-0'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Load Testing<br><br><br><span class='indent-0'>&#09;</span>NOTES:<br><br><span class='indent-0'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The majority of discharged batteries can be recharged using normal battery charging procedures. Some deeply discharged batteries or batteries which have been allowed to remain in a discharged state may need a higher charge voltage initially to start the recharging process.<br><br><span class='indent-0'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The Freedom battery is more resistant to overcharging damage than conventional batteries. Boost or Quick-Charge settings on battery chargers may be safely used in most instances. (This is not true of other non-Delco OE batteries and many aftermarket batteries.)<br><br><span class='indent-0'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>With the battery at room temperature, voltages as high as 15.0 volts to 16.0 volts may be safely used without causing battery damage. Cold batteries require more voltage to cause them to accept current. Warm batteries will accept less voltage without causing overcharging.<br><br><span class='indent-0'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After starting the battery on charge and periodically during the charging process, the battery should be cheeked to assure that it is not overcharging. Overcharging can be identified by excessive battery case temperature and electrolyte boiling or bubbling (or spewing out the vents).<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-10'>&#09;</span>Battery case temperatures of about 125~F is the maximum which should be allowed. Check by hand feel and reduce the charge rate if high temperatures are found.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-10'>&#09;</span>Excessive electrolyte bubbling or boiling indicates that the charge voltage is too high and that the battery is being forced to accept too much current. Turn down the charge rate if high temperatures are found.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-10'>&#09;</span>A battery with an internally shorted cell will show signs of overcharging at normally acceptable voltages. If charge voltages of around 13 volts result in overcharging (on a battery at room temperature or cooler), disconnect the battery and check the voltage. Batteries with internal shorts will exhibit a drop in voltage over time. Batteries with internal shorts should be scrapped.<br></div>
