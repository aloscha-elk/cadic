<h1>Wheels and Tires: Service and Repair</h1><br><br><b>Tire and Wheel Removal and Installation</b><br><br><b>Tools Required</b><br><br>J 39544-KIT Complete Torque Socket Set<br><br><b>Caution:</b> If penetrating oil gets on the vertical surfaces between the wheel and the rotor or drum it could cause the wheel to work loose as the vehicle is driven, resulting in loss of control and an injury accident. <br><br><b>Notice:</b> Never use heat to loosen a tight wheel. It can shorten the life of the wheel, studs, or hub and bearing assemblies. Wheel nuts must be tightened in sequence and to the specified torque to avoid bending the wheel or rotor.<br><br><b>Notice:</b> Improperly tightened wheel nuts can lead to brake pulsation and rotor damage. In order to avoid expensive brake repairs, evenly tighten the wheel nuts to the proper torque specification.<br><br><b>Important:</b> <b>Removing <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> can be difficult because of foreign material or a tight fit between the wheel center hole and the hub or rotor. Excessive force, such as hammering on the wheel or tire, can cause damage. Slightly tapping the tire side wall with a rubber mallet is acceptable.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tighten all wheel nuts on the affected wheel.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Loosen each wheel nut two turns.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Rock the vehicle from side to side in order to loosen the wheel.

Installing wheels with poor metal-to-metal contact at the mounting surfaces can cause wheel nuts to loosen. This can cause a wheel to come off when the vehicle is moving, causing loss of control and possibly personal injury.</b><br><br><b>Notice:</b> A torque wrench or J 39544 must be used to ensure that wheel nuts are tightened to specification. Never use lubricants or penetrating <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/Fluids/">fluids</a> on wheel stud, nuts, or mounting surfaces, as this can raise the actual torque on the nut without a corresponding torque reading on the torque wrench. Wheel nuts, studs, and mounting surfaces must be clean and dry. Failure to follow these instructions could result in wheel, nut, and/or stud damage.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/122973917.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Install the tire and wheel.
