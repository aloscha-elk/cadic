The battery positive voltage circuit provides power that the control module uses for keep alive memory (KAM). If the battery positive voltage circuit loses power, all HVAC DTCs and settings will be erased from KAM. The body control module (BCM), which is the vehicle mode master, provides a device on signal. The HVAC control module provides blower, air delivery mode, air temperature settings and input signals to auxiliary HVAC control module. The HVAC system assembly receives power from battery input with ignition 3 Voltage circuit as a backup.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/465112466.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The HVAC control module supports the features.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Auxiliary HVAC Control Module</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The auxiliary HVAC control module provides blower, air delivery mode and air temperature settings. When the auxiliary position is selected, from the HVAC control module, inputs from this <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Control%2520Assembly/index.html">control assembly</a> will be processed by the auxiliary HVAC control module. If equipped with rear seat audio (RSA) the auxiliary HVAC system will support GMLAN.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Front Temperature Actuators</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The front temperature actuators are 5-wire bi-directional electric motor that incorporates a feedback potentiometer. Ignition 3 relay voltage, low reference, control, <b>5-Volt</b> reference and position signal circuits enable the actuator to operate. The control circuit uses either, <b>0, 2.5 or 5-Volt</b> signal to command the actuator movement. When the actuator is at rest, the control circuit value is <b>2.5 volts</b>. A <b>0 or 5-Volt</b> control signal commands the actuator movement in opposite directions. When the actuator shaft rotates, the potentiometer adjustable contact changes the door position with a signal ranging between <b>0-5 volts</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The HVAC control module uses a range of 0-255 counts to index the actuator position. The door position signal voltage is converted to a 0-255 count range. When the module sets a commanded, or targeted, value, the control signal is changed to either <b>0 or 5 volts</b> depending upon the direction that the actuator needs to rotate to reach the commanded value. As the actuator shaft rotates the changing position signal is sent to the module. Once the position signal and the commanded value are the same, the module changes the control signal to <b>2.5 volts</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Auxiliary Temperature Actuator</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The auxiliary temperature actuator is a 5-wire bi-directional electric motor that incorporates a feedback potentiometer.

A <b>5-Volt</b> reference, low reference, and signal circuits enable the sensor to operate. The A/C pressure signal can be between <b>0-5 volts</b>. When the A/C <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Refrigerant/index.html">refrigerant</a> pressure is low, the signal value is near <b>0 volts</b>. When the A/C refrigerant pressure is high, the signal value is near <b>5 volts</b>. The PCM converts the voltage signal to a pressure value.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The A/C refrigerant pressure sensor protects the A/C system from operating when an excessively high pressure condition exists. The PCM disables the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Compressor%2520HVAC/Compressor%2520Clutch/index.html">compressor clutch</a> if the A/C pressure is more than <b>3234 kPa</b>. The clutch will be enabled after the pressure decreases to less than <b>1931 kPa</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Heating and A/C Operation</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The purpose of the heating and A/C system is to provide heated and cooled air to the interior of the vehicle. The A/C system will also remove humidity from the interior and reduce windshield fogging. Regardless of the temperature setting, the following can affect the rate that the HVAC system can achieve the desired temperature:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Recirculation actuator setting<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Difference between inside and desired temperature<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Difference between ambient and desired temperature<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Blower%2520Motor/index.html">Blower motor</a> speed setting<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Mode setting<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Auxiliary HVAC settings<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The manual HVAC system is a dual temperature zone system. There are 2 separate air temperature levers. Moving the air temperature levers to the upward position diverts most of the airflow through the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Heater%2520Core/index.html">heater core</a>, which increases the outlet air temperature. Moving the air temperature levers to the most downward position diverts most of the airflow around the heater core, which decreases the outlet air temperature. The right air temperature actuator controls the duct air temperature flowing through the center console to the second row seating passengers. The air temperature offset can be as much as <b>16.7&deg;C (30&deg;F)</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Pressing the A/C button enables the HVAC control module to request A/C compressor engagement and turn ON the A/C button LED. The HVAC control module sends a GMLAN message to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) for A/C compressor engagement. The PCM will provide a ground for the A/C compressor relay enabling it to close its internal contacts to send battery voltage to the A/C compressor clutch coil. The A/C compressor diode will prevent a voltage spike, resulting from the collapse of the magnetic field of the coil, from entering the vehicle electrical system when the compressor is disengaged. Defrost and Defog mode selections will request A/C operation but not turn ON the A/C LED.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The following conditions must be met in order for the A/C compressor clutch to turn ON:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ambient air temperature above <b>2&deg;C</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A/C low pressure switch signal circuit is grounded.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A/C refrigerant pressure sensor parameter is less than <b>3234 kPa</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A/C compressor temperature switch contacts are closed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>PCM receives an A/C request from the HVAC control module.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine coolant temperature (ECT) is less than <b>124&deg;C</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine RPM is less than <b>5800 RPM</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The sensor information is used by the PCM to determine the following:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The A/C high side pressure<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>An A/C system load on the engine<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>An excessive A/C high side pressure<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The heat load at the A/C condenser<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The A/C compressor has an A/C compressor temperature switch.

When the compressor core temperature rises above <b>124&deg;C (255&deg;F)</b> the switch opens, disabling the compressor clutch coil. When the temperature lowers to <b>120&deg;C (248&deg;F)</b> the switch closes, enabling the compressor clutch coil.

The heater core is located inside the HVAC module. The ambient air drawn through the HVAC module absorbs the heat of the coolant flowing through the heater core. Heated air is distributed to the passenger compartment, through the HVAC module, for passenger comfort. Opening or closing the air temperature door controls the amount of heat delivered to the passenger compartment. The coolant exits the heater core through the return heater hose and recirculated back through the engine cooling system.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>A/C Cycle</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Refrigerant/index.html">Refrigerant</a> is the key element in an air conditioning system.
