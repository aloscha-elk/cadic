<h1>Fuel: Specifications</h1><br><br><b>GASOLINE OCTANE</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Use premium unleaded gasoline with a posted octane rating of 91 or higher. You may also use regular unleaded gasoline rated at 87 octane or higher, but your vehicle's acceleration may be slightly reduced, and you may notice a slight audible knocking noise, commonly referred to as spark knock. If the octane is less than 87, you may notice a heavy knocking noise when you drive. If this occurs, use a gasoline rated at 87 octane or higher as soon as possible. Otherwise, you might damage your engine. If you are using gasoline rated at 87 octane or higher and you hear heavy knocking, your engine needs service.<br><br><b>GASOLINE SPECIFICATIONS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>At a minimum, gasoline should meet ASTM specification D 4814 in the United States or CAN/CGSB-3.5 in Canada. Some gasolines may contain an octane-enhancing additive called methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT). General Motors recommends against the use of gasolines containing MMT. <br><br><b>CALIFORNIA FUEL</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If your vehicle is certified to meet California Emission Standards, it is designed to operate on fuels that meet California specifications. See the underhood emission control label. If this fuel is not available in states adopting California emissions standards, your vehicle will operate satisfactorily on fuels meeting federal specifications, but emission control system performance may be affected. The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Malfunction%2520Indicator%2520Lamp/index.html">malfunction indicator lamp</a> may turn on and your vehicle may fail a smog-check test. If it is determined that the condition is caused by the type of fuel used, repairs may not be covered by your warranty.<br><br><b>ADDITIVES</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>To provide cleaner air, all gasolines in the United States are now required to contain additives that will help prevent engine and fuel system deposits from forming, allowing your emission control system to work properly. In most cases, you should not have to add anything to your fuel. However, some gasolines contain only the minimum amount of additive required to meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations. To help keep fuel injectors and intake valves clean, or if your vehicle experiences problems due to dirty injectors or valves, look for gasoline that is advertised as TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline. Also, your dealer has additives that will help correct and prevent most deposit-related problems.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Gasolines containing oxygenates, such as ethers and ethanol, and reformulated gasolines may be available in your area. General Motors recommends that you use these gasolines if they comply with the specifications described earlier. However, E85 (85% ethanol) and other fuels containing more than 10% ethanol must not be used in vehicles that were not designed for those fuels.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>NOTICE:</b>  Your vehicle was not designed for fuel that contains methanol. Do not use fuel containing methanol. It can corrode metal parts in the fuel system and also damage plastic and rubber parts. That damage would not be covered under your warranty. <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Some gasolines that are not reformulated for low emissions may contain an octane-enhancing additive called methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT); ask the attendant where you buy gasoline whether the fuel contains MMT. General Motors recommends against the use of such gasolines. Fuels containing MMT can reduce the life of <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Tune-up%2520and%2520Engine%2520Performance%2520Checks/Spark%2520Plug/index.html">spark plugs</a> and the performance of the emission control system may be affected. The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Malfunction%2520Indicator%2520Lamp/index.html">malfunction indicator lamp</a> may turn on. If this occurs, return to your dealer for service.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>NOTICE:</b> Your vehicle was not designed for fuel that contains methanol.

Never use leaded gasoline or any other fuel not recommended in the previous text on fuel. Costly repairs caused by use of improper fuel would not be covered by your warranty. To check the fuel availability, ask an auto club, or contact a major oil company that does business in the country where you will be driving.<br></div>
