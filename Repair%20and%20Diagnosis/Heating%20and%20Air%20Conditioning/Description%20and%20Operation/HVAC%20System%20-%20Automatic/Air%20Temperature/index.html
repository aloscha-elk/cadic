The battery positive voltage circuit provides power that the control module uses for keep alive memory (KAM). If the battery positive voltage circuit loses power, all HVAC DTCs and settings will be erased from KAM. The body control module (BCM), which is the vehicle mode master, provides a device on signal. The control module supports the features.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Auxiliary HVAC Control Module</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The auxiliary HVAC control module is a GMLAN device that receives analog inputs from the front HVAC control assembly and GMLAN message inputs from the rear seat audio control module to maintain auxiliary air temperature and auxiliary air distribution settings. The battery positive voltage circuit provides power that the control module uses for KAM. If the battery positive voltage circuit loses power, all auxiliary HVAC DTCs and settings will be erased from KAM. The auxiliary HVAC control module will perform a recalibration of the electric actuators when commanded with a scan tool or if KAM is lost. This will ensure the actuators are moving with in the calibrated range.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Rear Seat Audio Control Module</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The rear seat audio control module is a GMLAN device that interfaces between the rear seat passengers and the auxiliary HVAC control module. The battery positive voltage circuit provides power that the control module uses for KAM. Air temperature, <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Blower%2520Motor/index.html">blower motor</a> and air delivery rocker type switches are located on the face of the module. Pressing a switch enables the module to send a GMLAN serial data message to the auxiliary HVAC control module for the change request. The module does not store auxiliary HVAC DTCs.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Air Temperature Actuator</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The air temperature actuators are a 5-wire bi-directional electric motor that incorporates a feedback potentiometer. Ignition 3 voltage, low reference, control, <b>5-Volt</b> reference and position signal circuits enable the actuator to operate. The control circuit uses either a <b>0, 2.5 or 5 volt</b> signal to command the actuator movement. When the actuator is at rest, the control circuit value is <b>2.5 volts</b>. A <b>0 or 5-Volt</b> control signal commands the actuator movement in opposite directions. When the actuator shaft rotates, the potentiometers adjustable contact changes the door position signal between <b>0-5 volts</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The HVAC control module uses a range of 0-255 counts to index the actuator position. The door position signal voltage is converted to a 0-255 count range. When the module sets a commanded, or targeted, value, the control signal is changed to either <b>0 or 5 volts</b> depending upon the direction that the actuator needs to rotate to reach the commanded value. As the actuator shaft rotates the changing position signal is sent to the module. Once the position signal and the commanded value are the same, the module changes the control signal to <b>2.5 volts</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Auxiliary Air Temperature Actuator</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The auxiliary air temperature actuator is a 5-wire bi-directional electric motor that incorporates a feedback potentiometer. Ignition 3 voltage, low reference, control, <b>5-Volt</b> reference and position signal circuits enable the actuator to operate. The control circuit uses either a <b>0, 2.5 or 5-Volt</b> signal to command the actuator movement. When the actuator is at rest, the control circuit value is <b>2.5 volts</b>. A <b>0 or 5-Volt</b> control signal commands the actuator movement in opposite directions.

The vehicle uses the following air temperature sensors:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ambient Air Temperature Sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inside Air Temperature Sensor Assembly<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Upper Left Air Temperature Sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Upper Right Air Temperature Sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lower Left Air Temperature Sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lower Right Air Temperature Sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Upper Air Temperature Sensor - Auxiliary<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lower Air Temperature Sensor - Auxiliary<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>A signal and low reference circuit enables the sensor to operate. As the air temperature surrounding the sensor increases, the sensor resistance decreases. The sensor signal voltage decreases as the resistance decreases. The sensor operates within a temperature range between <b>-40&deg; to +101&deg;C (-40&deg; to +215&deg;F)</b>. The sensor signal varies between <b>0-5 volts</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The input of the duct air temperature sensors are different from the ambient and inside air temperature sensors. The HVAC control module converts the signal to a range between 0-255 counts. As the air temperature increases the count value will decrease. If the HVAC control module or auxiliary HVAC control module detects a malfunctioning sensor, then the control module software will use a defaulted air temperature value. The default value for the ambient and inside air temperature sensors will be displayed on the scan tool. The default value for the duct air temperature sensors will not be displayed on the scan tool. The scan tool parameter for the duct air temperature sensors are the actual state of the signal circuit. The default action ensures that the HVAC system can adjust the inside air temperature near the desired temperature until the condition is corrected.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/465147811.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The ambient air temperature sensor mounts underhood and can be affected by city traffic, by idling, and by restarting a hot engine. Therefore, the HVAC control module filters the value of the ambient air temperature sensor for temperature display. The ambient air temperature value is updated under the conditions.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The scan tool has the ability to update the displayed ambient air temperature. To update the ambient air temperature display on the HVAC control module, perform the following procedure: Turn ON the ignition. Simultaneously press the A/C and Recirc switches for <b>5 seconds</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Sunload Sensor Assembly</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The sunload sensor is a 2-wire photo diode. The vehicle uses left and right sunload sensors. The 2 sensors are integrated into the sunload sensor assembly. Low reference and signal circuits enable the sensor to operate. As the light shining upon the sensor gets brighter, the sensor resistance increases. The sensor signal decreases as the resistance increases. The sensor operates within an intensity range between completely dark and bright. The sensor signal varies between <b>0-5 volts</b>. The HVAC control module converts the signal to a range between 0-255 counts. The sunload sensor provides the HVAC control module a measurement of the amount of light shining on the vehicle. Bright, or high intensity, light causes the vehicles inside temperature to increase. The HVAC system compensates for the increased temperature by diverting additional cool air into the vehicle. If the HVAC control module detects a malfunctioning sensor, then the control module software will use a defaulted sunload value. This value will not be displayed on the scan tool. The default action ensures that the HVAC system can adjust the inside air temperature near the desired temperature until the condition is fixed. The scan tool parameter for the sunload sensor is the actual state of the signal circuit.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>A/C Refrigerant Pressure Sensor</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The A/C refrigerant pressure sensor is a 3-wire piezoelectric pressure transducer. A <b>5-Volt</b> reference, low reference, and signal circuits enable the sensor to operate. The A/C pressure signal can be between <b>0-5 volts</b>. When the A/C <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Refrigerant/index.html">refrigerant</a> pressure is low, the signal value is near <b>0 volts</b>. When the A/C refrigerant pressure is high, the signal value is near <b>5 volts</b>. The powertrain control module (PCM) converts the voltage signal to a pressure value.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The A/C refrigerant pressure sensor protects the A/C system from operating when an excessively high pressure condition exists. The PCM disables the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Compressor%2520HVAC/Compressor%2520Clutch/index.html">compressor clutch</a> if the A/C pressure is more than <b>2957 kPa (429 psi)</b>. The clutch will be enabled after the pressure decreases to less than <b>1578 kPa (229 psi)</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The A/C low pressure switch protects the A/C system from a low pressure condition that could damage the A/C compressor or cause evaporator icing. The HVAC control module applies <b>5 volts</b> to the A/C low pressure switch signal circuit. The switch will open when the A/C low side pressure reaches <b>151 kPa (22 psi)</b>. This prevents the A/C compressor from operating. The switch will then close when A/C low pressure side reaches <b>275 kPa (40 psi)</b>. This enables the A/C compressor to turn back ON.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Heating and A/C Operation</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The purpose of the heating and A/C system is to provide heated and cooled air to the interior of the vehicle. The A/C system will also remove humidity from the interior and reduce windshield fogging. The vehicle operator can determine the passenger compartment temperature by adjusting the air temperature switch. The vehicle passenger can offset the passenger temperature as much as <b>16.7&deg;C (30&deg;F)</b>.

The HVAC control module sends a GMLAN message to the powertrain control module (PCM) for A/C compressor engagement. The PCM will provide a ground for the A/C compressor relay enabling it to close its internal contacts to send battery voltage to the A/C compressor clutch coil. The A/C compressor diode will prevent a voltage spike, resulting from the collapse of the magnetic field of the coil, from entering the vehicle electrical system when the compressor is disengaged.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The following conditions must be met in order for the A/C compressor clutch to turn ON if they are not all met and an A/C request is made the LED on the A/C switch will flash:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ambient air temperature above <b>7&deg;C (45&deg;F)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A/C low pressure switch signal circuit is grounded<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A/C refrigerant pressure sensor parameter is less than <b>2957 kPa (429 psi)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>PCM receives an A/C request from the HVAC control module<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine coolant temperature (ECT) is less than <b>121&deg;C (250&deg;F)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine rpm is more than <b>550 RPM</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The throttle position is less than <b>100 percent</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The HVAC control module monitors the A/C low pressure switch signal circuit. If the voltage signal on this circuit has no voltage drop the module will interpret this condition as a low pressure, disabling the A/C request. The A/C low pressure switch will open its internal contacts at <b>151 kPa (22 psi)</b>. Then close the contacts at <b>275 kPa (40 psi)</b> to resume A/C operation. This switch assists in cycling the A/C compressor and prevents A/C compressor operation if system has a low <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Maintenance/Fluids/Refrigerant/index.html">refrigerant</a> level.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The PCM monitors the A/C refrigerant pressure sensor signal circuit.

These features are determined by the intake air temperature (IAT) during activation sequence and are maintained for the duration of engine run time. Calibratable temperatures are utilized to provide low, mid and high temperature ranges for the selectable feature. Blower and mode have the range to select any valid feature positions. When the remote start active serial data is received, ignition-OFF loop HVAC algorithms will act the same as if a run power mode was received, i.e. re-calibration, afterblow, ignition-OFF motor positioning etc. The OFF timer and the ignition ON timer have the functionality as in the Run mode.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Remote Start De-activation</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the remote start is exited, GMLAN power mode equals run mode or remote start engine. In the case of automatic settings, the displays will revert to the actual state of operation of the features, on the basis of their normal control algorithms.</div>
