Be sure to understand the customer's driving habits as this will also heavily influence the tire wear performance; tire wear from aggressive or abusive driving habits is NOT a warrantable condition.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Slight or mild feathering, cupping, edge or heel/toe wear of tire tread shoulders is "normal" and can show up very early in a tire/vehicle service mileage; in fact, some new <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> can show evidence of feathering from the factory.

Please note the customer's concern with the wear such as, noise, appearance, wear life, etc. A field product report with pictures of the tire wear condition is recommended.

Be sure to verify from the customer the types of roads they are driving as they may not recognize the influence of road crown on vehicle lead/pull and steering wheel angle. If a vehicle requires significant steering effort to prevent it from "climbing" the road crown there may be an issue to be looked into further.<br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>A wheel alignment will generally NOT correct vehicles that follow the road crown since this is within "Normal Operation." </b><br><br><b>Mileage Policy</b><br><br>The following mileage policy applies for E2020 and E2000 labor operations: <br><b>Note</b><br>Wheel Alignment is NOT covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty for Express and Savana Cutaway vehicles as these vehicles require Upfitters to set the wheel alignment after completing the vehicles.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>0-800 km (0-500 mi): </b> E2000/E2020 claims ONLY allowed with Call Center Authorization. Due to the tie down during shipping, the vehicle's suspension requires some time to reach normal operating position. For this reason, new vehicles are generally NOT to be aligned until they have accumulated at least 800 km (500 mi). A field product report should accompany any claim within this mileage range. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>801-12,000 km (501-7,500 mi): </b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If a vehicle came from the factory with incorrect alignment settings, any resulting off-angle steering wheel, lead/pull characteristics or the rare occurrence of excessive tire wear would be apparent early in the life of the vehicle.
