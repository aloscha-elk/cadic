<h1>Trim Height Inspection</h1><br><br><b>Trim Height Inspection</b><br><br><b>Trim Height Measurements</b><br><br>Trim height is a predetermined measurement relating to vehicle ride height. Incorrect trim heights can cause bottoming out over bumps, damage to the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> components, and symptoms similar to wheel alignment problems. Check the trim heights when diagnosing suspension concerns and before checking the wheel alignment.<br><br>Perform the following before measuring the trim heights:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ensure the vehicle is on a level surface, such as an alignment rack.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ensure that the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> is fully supporting the vehicle.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the alignment rack floating pins.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Set the tire pressures to the pressure shown on the certification label. Refer to Vehicle Certification, Tire Place Card, Anti-Theft, and Service Parts ID Label.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the fuel level.

Vehicles equipped with <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Suspension/Torsion%2520Bar/index.html">torsion bars</a> use a adjusting arm in order to adjust the Z height dimension. Vehicles without torsion bars have no adjustment and could require replacement of <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Suspension/">suspension</a> components.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b> <b>All dimensions are measured vertical to ground.
