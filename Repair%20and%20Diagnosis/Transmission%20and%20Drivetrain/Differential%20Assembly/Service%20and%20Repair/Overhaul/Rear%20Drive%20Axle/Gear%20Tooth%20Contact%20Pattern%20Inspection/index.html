<h1>Gear Tooth Contact Pattern Inspection</h1><br><br><b>Gear Tooth Contact Pattern Inspection</b><br><br>The gear contact pattern check is not a substitute for adjusting the pinion depth and backlash. Use this method in order to verify the correct running position of the ring gear and the drive pinion. Gear sets which are not positioned properly may be noisy and/or have a short life span. A pattern check ensures that when best contact has been obtained between the ring gear and the drive pinion, the system will produce low noise and have a long life.<br><br><b>Drive Pinion and Ring Gear Identification</b><br><br>Production drive pinion and ring gears are manufactured by using a 2-cut or a 5-cut method. The 2-cut drive pinions and ring gears can be identified by having a groove cut into the outside edge of the ring gear and a ring on the stem of the drive pinion. The gear tooth contact patterns that are produced from each style of gear set differ slightly. A 2-cut gear will produce a pattern that is bias from the toe to the heel of the tooth (drive side), while a 5-cut gear set will produce a square pattern from the toe to the heel of the tooth (drive side). When diagnosing the gear tooth contact pattern, regardless of what type of gear set it is, a correct pattern will be centered within the area of the tooth, from toe to heel and from top to bottom.<br><br><b>Gear Tooth Nomenclature</b><br><br><h3>Gear Tooth Nomenclature:</h3><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/391021671.png"></div><br><br><br><br>The side of the ring gear tooth which curves outward, or is convex, is the drive side (4). The concave side is the coast side (3). The end of the tooth nearest the center of the ring gear is the toe end (2). The end of the tooth farthest away from the center is the heel end (1).<br><br><b>Adjustments Affecting Tooth Contact</b><br><br>The following 2 adjustments affect the tooth contact pattern:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Backlash adjustment<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pinion depth adjustment<br><br>The effects of bearing preloads are not readily apparent on hand-loaded tooth contact pattern tests. However, bearing preloads should be within specifications before proceeding with backlash and pinion depth adjustments.<br><br><b>Backlash Adjustment</b><br><br>The backlash can be adjusted by either varying the thickness of the side bearing shims from side to side or by moving the adjuster sleeve(s) in or out, or both. By adjusting the shim thickness or moving the adjuster sleeve(s), the case and ring gear assembly will move closer to or further away from the pinion. In most cases, adjusting the backlash will correct an abnormal contact pattern. This adjustment will also be used to set the side bearing preload.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the thickness of the right shim is increased or the adjuster sleeve is moved in (if applicable), along with an equal decrease in the thickness of the left shim or the adjuster sleeve is moved out (if applicable), the backlash will increase.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the thickness of the left shim is increased or the adjuster sleeve is moved in (if applicable), along with an equal decrease in the thickness of the right shim or the adjuster sleeve is moved out (if applicable), the backlash will decrease.<br><br><b>Pinion Depth Adjustment</b><br><br>Adjust the position of the pinion by increasing or decreasing the distance between the pinion head and the centerline of the ring gear. Decreasing the distance moves the pinion closer to the centerline of the ring gear. Increasing the distance moves the pinion farther away from the centerline of the ring gear.<br><br><b>Testing Procedure</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wipe clean the differential case, the ring gear and the axle housing of lubricant.
