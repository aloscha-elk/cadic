The APP sensor 1 signal voltage at rest position is less than <b>1 volt</b> and increases to above <b>4 volts</b> as the pedal is actuated.

The TP sensors provide the engine control module (ECM) with a signal voltage proportional to throttle plate movement.

The ECM determines the drivers intent and then calculates the appropriate throttle response. The ECM achieves throttle positioning by providing a pulse width modulated voltage to the TAC motor.<br><br><b>MODES OF OPERATION</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Normal Mode</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>During the operation of the throttle actuator control (TAC) system, several modes or functions are considered normal. The following modes may be entered during normal operation:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Minimum pedal value-At key-up the engine control module (ECM) updates the learned minimum pedal value.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Minimum throttle position (TP) values-At key-up the ECM updates the learned minimum TP value. In order to learn the minimum TP value, the throttle blade is moved to the closed position.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Ice break mode-If the throttle is not able to reach a predetermined minimum throttle position, the ice break mode is entered. During the ice break mode, the ECM commands the maximum pulse width several times to the throttle actuator motor in the closing direction.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Battery saver mode-After a predetermined time without engine RPM, the ECM commands the battery saver mode. During the battery saver mode, the TAC module removes the voltage from the motor control circuits, which removes the current draw used to maintain the idle position and allows the throttle to return to the spring loaded default position.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Reduced Engine Power Mode</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the ECM detects a condition with the TAC system, the ECM may enter a reduced engine power mode. Reduced engine power may cause one or more of the following conditions:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Acceleration limiting-The ECM will continue to use the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Accelerator%2520Pedal/index.html">accelerator pedal</a> for throttle control; however, the vehicle acceleration is limited.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Limited throttle mode-The ECM will continue to use the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Accelerator%2520Pedal/index.html">accelerator pedal</a> for throttle control; however, the maximum throttle opening is limited.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Throttle default mode-The ECM will turn off the throttle actuator motor and the throttle will return to the spring loaded default position.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Forced idle mode-The ECM will perform the following actions:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Limit engine speed to idle by positioning the throttle position, or by controlling the fuel and spark if the throttle is turned off.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Ignore the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Accelerator%2520Pedal/index.html">accelerator pedal</a> input.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine shutdown mode-The ECM will disable fuel and de-energize the throttle actuator.</div>
