<h1>A/T - Shift Stabilization/Tow Haul Mode Features</h1><b>INFORMATION</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.: </b>08-07-30-030A<br><br><b>Date: </b>October 17, 2011<br><br><b>Subject: </b>(R)Shift Stabilization, Tow/Haul Mode and Cruise Grade Braking Features for Hydra-Matic 6L80/6L90 Automatic Transmissions<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2007-2012 Cadillac Escalade, Escalade ESV, Escalade EXT<br>2007-2012 Chevrolet Avalanche, Silverado, Suburban, Tahoe<br>2010-2012 Chevrolet Express<br>2007-2012 GMC Sierra, Sierra Denali, Yukon, Yukon Denali, Yukon XL Denali<br>2010-2012 GMC Savana<br>2008-2009 HUMMER H2<br><br>Equipped with 6L80 (MYC) or 6L90 (MYD) Automatic Transmission<br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to add Express and Savana models, add model years and add a Cruise Grade Braking feature section. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 08-07-30-030 (Section 07 - Transmission/Transaxle). <br><br><b>Bulletin Content</b><br><br>This bulletin contains information regarding Shift Stabilization, Tow/Haul mode and Cruise Grade Braking. These features affect transmission shift patterns and the customer's perception of shift feel. Customers may notice a change in shift patterns between previously owned vehicles without shift stabilization and current vehicles with shift stabilization.<br><br><b>Shift Stabilization</b><br><br>Applies to all above listed models.<br><br><b>PURPOSE</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Some customers may comment that upshifts are delayed or not available when in fact the transmission is operating normally with a feature known as "shift stabilization." This may contribute to "cannot duplicate/no trouble found." It is important that the customer be educated about this feature if this occurs.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The purpose of shift stabilization is to reduce shift busyness during conditions that would otherwise produce frequent upshifts and downshifts, such as trailering, operating on grades or at higher altitudes.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Shift stabilization is an algorithm in a vehicle's software/calibration that determines if and when to prevent upshifts under load. Shift stabilization only affects upshifts and not downshifts.<br><br><b>ACTIVATION</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>This feature is internal to the vehicle's software/calibration and requires no customer action to activate.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Shift stabilization is effective in normal mode, cruise mode, and in tow/haul mode.<br><br><b>FUNCTION</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Shift stabilization calculates the required torque at the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> in the current gear as well as the maximum torque available at the wheels in the next higher gear. If the torque in the higher gear is not sufficient, the transmission will remain in the current gear. If the torque in the higher gear is greater than or equal to the required torque, than the upshift is allowed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>High throttle opening will disable shift stabilization and normal downshifts will occur.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Shift stabilization occurs in the 6L80/6L90 for only 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, and 5-6 upshifts.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Shift stabilization might be disengaged in the following situations:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>During cruise control operation when the "decrease" button is tapped or held, shift stabilization may be disengaged.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If a significant "bump" in the road is encountered, shift stabilization may be disengaged.<br><br><b>Tow/Haul Mode</b><br><br>Applies to all models listed above:<br><br><b>PURPOSE</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>It is important to note that the customer may accidentally engage the tow/haul button and then comment about delayed or harsh shifts when not pulling a trailer or under heavy load. Normal function of tow/haul mode when used in inappropriate conditions may contribute to complaints that "cannot duplicate/no trouble found."<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tow /Haul mode will optimize gear selection for operation with heavy loads (such as towing):<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>optimize acceleration performance for launches and rolling accelerations<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>reduce shift cycling<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>optimize braking performance and speed control during engine braking situations<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>improve vehicle speed control while requiring less throttle pedal activity<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Because tow/haul mode maintains lower gears longer and increases shift pressures, it will degrade fuel economy and generate shift feel concerns if it is used inappropriately in unloaded driving conditions.<br><br><b>ACTIVATION</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tow/Haul is selected or de-selected via a switch on the end of the transmission shift lever for all models. A light on the instrument panel will illuminate to indicate that tow/haul has been selected.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tow/Haul must be reselected every time the vehicle is started (if desired).<br><br><b>FUNCTION</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tow/Haul is designed to be most effective when the vehicle and trailer combined weight is at least 75% of the vehicle's Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Operation of tow/haul in a lightly loaded or non-loaded vehicle will not cause damage. However, there is no benefit to the selection of tow/haul when the vehicle is unloaded. The tow/haul switch is not a performance switch.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Selection of tow/haul when unloaded may result in unpleasant engine and transmission driving characteristics and reduced fuel economy, since upshifts occur at higher engine speeds. Tow/Haul is recommend only when pulling a heavy trailer or a large or heavy load.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Automatic downshifting (Normal - Powertrain Braking) to assist speed control will activate when Tow/Haul mode is active and the brake pedal is depressed (even lightly). Downshifts are commanded at higher speeds than normal resulting in engine braking that assists with speed control. After a powertrain braking situation ends, upshifts will typically be commanded when the accelerator pedal is pushed down. (a quick increase in accel pedal may be required)<br><br>Refer to vehicle Owner's Manual for further information regarding tow/haul mode.<br><br><b>Cruise Grade Braking</b><br><br>Applies to all 2009 and newer models listed above.<br><br><b>PURPOSE</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Cruise grade braking assists when driving on a downhill grade.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>It maintains vehicle speed by automatically implementing a shift schedule that uses the engine and the transmission to slow the vehicle.<br><br><b>ACTIVATION</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>This feature is internal to the vehicle's software/calibration and requires no customer action to activate.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>In 2009-2011 model years, cruise grade braking is effective only in tow/haul mode when cruise control is engaged. In 2012 model year, cruise grade braking is effective in both tow/haul mode AND normal mode when cruise control is engaged.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Cruise grade braking is not available in Range Selection Mode.<br><br><b>FUNCTION</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Automatic downshifting to assist in speed control will activate when vehicle speed has increased from the set point by a certain amount. Multiple downshift may be commanded depending on the amount of deviation of vehicle speed to the set speed. As vehicle speed slows and approaches the original set speed, upshifts will be commanded to return to a normal operating condition.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>At some speeds and on some downhill grades, the transmission may not be able to command a gear low enough to slow the vehicle to the set point without overspeeding the engine.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>In this case the transmission will command all available downshifts, but if further engine braking is desired, the driver must press the brake pedal to slow the vehicle enough so additional downshift(s) can be commanded.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pressing the brake pedal has the normal effect of cancelling cruise control operation and in this case a transition to Normal - Powertrain Braking is completed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>As always, if cruise control operation was cancelled through usage of the brake pedal, it must be reinitiated by tapping either the Set or Resume Cruise switches.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br></div>
