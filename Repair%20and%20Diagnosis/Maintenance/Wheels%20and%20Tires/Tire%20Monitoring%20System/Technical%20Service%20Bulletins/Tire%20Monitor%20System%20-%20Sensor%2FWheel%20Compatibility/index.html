<h1>Tire Monitor System - Sensor/Wheel Compatibility</h1>Bulletin No.: 06-03-16-001<br><br>Date: August 17, 2006<br><br>INFORMATION<br><br>Subject:<br>Tire Pressure Monitor (TPM) Sensors for GM Accessory and Aftermarket Wheels/Tires<br><br>Models:<br>2007 Cadillac Escalade, Escalade ESV, Escalade EXT<br>2007 Chevrolet Avalanche, Suburban, Tahoe<br>2007 GMC Yukon, Yukon XL, Yukon Denali. Yukon Denali XL<br><br>Some customers may elect to purchase GM Accessory wheels/tires or aftermarket wheels/tires that require the proper tire pressure sensors to be installed in each wheel and tire assembly.<br><br>The 2007 model year full-size trucks require unique tire pressure sensors which are not interchangeable with past model year sensors or with other GM models not listed above.<br><br>Installing the wrong tire pressure sensors in any road wheel will cause a "Service Tire Pressure" message and one or more DTCs to set.<br><br>All 2007 models listed above were shipped from the assembly plant(s) with the proper tire pressure sensors installed in each wheel/tire assembly and the sensors were properly programmed to the vehicle. Each sensor has its own unique ID code that can be displayed on the J-46079 special tool.<br><br>Part numbers of compatible TPM sensors are as follows:<br><br>-<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>15825475 - this sensor comes shipped from the assembly plant (black, TRW). This sensor can also be obtained in a 16 Pack as 19157606.<br><br>-<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>15268606 - this is a compatible sensor for the 2007 full-size trucks (green, Schrader). This sensor is also used on 2007 Impala, Monte Carlo and DTS models. This sensor can also be obtained in a 16 Pack as 19155710.<br><br>-<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>15114379 - this is NOT compatible with the 2007 model year full-size trucks. This is the sensor for 2006 and earlier trucks.<br><br>Dealers who experience TPM problems after the installation of GM accessory wheels/tires or aftermarket wheels/tires should verify that the tire pressure sensors are the correct part number sensor for the vehicle and can communicate with the J-46079.<br><br>If the J-46079 displays the individual tire pressure sensor IDs, but the vehicle will not learn the sensors, dealers should use the "simulate" feature on the J-46079.<br><br>In the "simulate" mode, the J-46079 transmits four unique "test" IDs to the vehicle. This allows the user to test the vehicle's ability to learn tire pressure sensors.<br><br>The "test" IDs sent by the tool are for test purposes only. Valid sensor IDs must be pre-programmed into the vehicle after the "simulate" mode has been used.<br><br>Testing the Vehicle's Ability to Learn Using the "Simulate" Feature on the J-46079<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn ON the ignition with the engine OFF.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Apply the parking brake.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the learn module cannot be enabled, ensure that the TPM system is enabled in the RCDLR. Refer to Control Module Setup in SI. <br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Using the driver information center (DIC), press the vehicle information button until the RELEARN TIRE POSITIONS message displays. If the vehicle does not have the DIC buttons, press the trip odometer reset stem located on the instrument panel cluster until the RELEARN TIRE POSITIONS message displays.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the vehicle has the DIC buttons, press the set/reset button. The horn will sound twice to indicate the TPMs receiver is ready, and the TIRE LEARNING ACTIVE message will display. If the vehicle does not have the DIC buttons, press and hold the trip odometer reset stem until the horn chirps twice and the TIRE LEARNING ACTIVE message is displayed.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Alternate method: Lower the driver's window and simultaneously press the keyless entry transmitters lock and unlock buttons until a horn chirp sounds. A horn chirp will sound indicating the learn mode has been enabled.<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Place the J-46079 in the "simulate" mode. Follow the tool prompts and program all tour tire positions into the vehicle. A horn single chirp will follow the programming for each position. A double horn chirp will indicate the learning sequence has been successful. When you have successfully used the "simulate" mode, the tool will display the simulated sensor IDs and tire pressure for each tire position.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tip:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The tire pressures displayed by the tool will not agree with the tire pressures displayed by the DIC. This is an anomaly with the tool software and does not indicate a problem. A double horn chirp after the fourth tire is programmed indicates that the vehicle can learn TPM sensors.<br><br>Warranty Information<br><br>Warranty claims should not be submitted for incorrect tire pressure sensors found in GM Accessory wheel/tire assemblies. Incorrect sensors assembled into GM Accessory wheels/tires or aftermarket wheels/tires by GM dealers or other sources are the responsibility of the installer or vehicle owner.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer</div>
