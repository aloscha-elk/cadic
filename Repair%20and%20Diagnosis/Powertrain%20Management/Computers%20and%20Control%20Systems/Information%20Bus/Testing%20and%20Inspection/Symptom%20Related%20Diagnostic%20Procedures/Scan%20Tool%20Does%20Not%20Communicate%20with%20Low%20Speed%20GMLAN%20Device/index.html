Operating information and commands are exchanged among the modules when the <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Starting%20and%20Charging/Starting%20System/Ignition%20Switch/">ignition switch</a> is in any position other than OFF. The low speed GMLAN serial data circuit must be operational for the vehicle to start so the vehicle theft deterrent (VTD) module and body control module (BCM) can communicate. The low speed GMLAN serial data circuit uses SP203 as the common connection between the modules and the data link connector (DLC).<br><br><b>DIAGNOSTIC AIDS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use the Data Link References to identify the low speed GMLAN serial data modules.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>This test is used for a total low speed GMLAN communication failure. If only 1 module is not communicating and sets no DTC, ensure that the vehicle is equipped with the module, then use DTC U0100-U0299 for diagnostics.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>An open in the low speed GMLAN serial data circuit between the splice pack and a module will only effect the specific module.
