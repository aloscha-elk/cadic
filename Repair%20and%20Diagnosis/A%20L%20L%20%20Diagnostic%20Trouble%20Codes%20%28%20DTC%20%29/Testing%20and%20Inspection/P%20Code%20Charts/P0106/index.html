This is an explicit model-based diagnostic containing 4 separate models for the intake system.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The throttle model describes the flow through the throttle body and is used to estimate the MAF through the throttle body as a function of barometric pressure (BARO), TP, intake air temperature (IAT), and estimated MAP. The information from this model is displayed on the scan tool as the MAF Performance Test parameter.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The first intake manifold model describes the intake manifold and is used to estimate MAP as a function of the MAF into the manifold from the throttle body and the MAF out of the manifold caused by engine pumping. The flow into the manifold from the throttle uses the MAF estimate calculated from the above throttle model. The information from this model is displayed on the scan tool as the MAP Performance Test 1 parameter.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The second intake manifold model is identical to the first intake manifold model except that the MAF sensor measurement is used instead of the throttle model estimate for the throttle air input. The information from this model is displayed on the scan tool as the MAP Performance Test 2 parameter.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The fourth model is created from the combination and additional calculations of the throttle model and the first intake manifold model.
