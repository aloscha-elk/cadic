<h1>Navigation System - Replacement Navigation Discs</h1>Bulletin No.: 07-08-44-007<br><br>Date: April 17, 2007<br><br>INFORMATION<br><br>Subject:<br>Information on Obtaining Replacement Navigation Discs When Radios are Exchanged - Order Replacement Navigation Disc Through Navigation Disc Center<br><br>Models:<br>2007 and Prior GM Passenger Cars and Trucks (Including Saturn)<br>2007 and Prior HUMMER H2, H3<br>2007 and Prior Saab 9-7X<br><br>with a Navigation Radio<br><br><b>Attention:</b><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The purpose of this bulletin is to inform dealership personnel of a new procedure for obtaining a replacement navigation disc for radios that are sent to an ESC for exchange. This bulletin applies to U.S. and Canadian dealers only and is not intended for use by export dealers.<br><br>When a navigation radio warranty exchange is performed, the customer must have a navigation disc to operate the new radio. If the customer's navigation disc was damaged or is stuck in the failed radio, the customer would have to wait for an excessive period of time for the disc to be returned or replaced. The Electronic Service Centers (ESC) are not authorized to remove stuck navigation discs from cores, as the cores must be returned to the supplier for analysis prior to any disassembly. The time it would take for the supplier to return the navigation disc would significantly delay the completion of the repair at the dealership.<br><br>If the customer's navigation disc is damaged or cannot be removed from the radio, the dealership is to obtain an exchange radio through an ESC and a new navigation disc through the GM Navigation Disc Center. Both items can be shipped overnight to the dealership upon request.<br><br>GM Navigation Disc Center Contact Information<br><br>Via the web through gmnavdisc.com<br><br>The GM Navigation Disc Center is also the center of expertise for <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Navigation%20System/">navigation system</a> questions.<br><br>Warranty Information<br><br>Include the part number and cost of the new navigation disc on the warranty claim for the navigation radio exchange.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br></div>
