<h1>Division Owner Letter</h1>Division Owner Letter<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/75750568.png"></div><br><br><br><br><b>Notice to Customer</b><br><br>General Motors released this product recall in accordance with the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act because a defect that relates to motor vehicle safety exists in your vehicle. It was implemented to address the potential consequences of a printed circuit board electrical short within the Heated Washer Fluid System (HWFS). The significance of this failure can vary from minor distortion to considerable melting of the plastic around the HWFS fluid chamber. In some circumstances, it is possible for the heated washer module to cause a fire. <br><br>This failure can occur at any time, even when the vehicle is unattended - parked and key not in the "ON" position. Note that a resulting under hood fire could also involve other nearby vehicles or structures. Performance of this recall procedure will allow your GM dealer to eliminate these risks by permanently removing the HWFS from your vehicle. In addition to the risk of a thermal incident, including a fire, it is possible that the HWFS will become inoperative at a future time. If this occurs, it will not be repaired or replaced by GM. Note that GM does not endorse or otherwise approve the use of any similar HWFS products that may be sold by aftermarket suppliers. <br><br>Even though you have declined to have this safety recall performed on your vehicle, please be advised that if you change your mind, your GM dealer will always be available to remove the HWFS from your vehicle and provide reimbursement according to the terms described in the recall notification letter.<br> <br>As part of this declination process, your dealer will ask you to document your refusal to have Safety Recall 10153 performed on your vehicle by signing a Repair Order stating "customer declined recall repair". You will be given a copy of this document for your records. Of course, your signature is voluntary but doing so will help prevent the mailing of recall reminder notices to you as the current owner of record. <br>If you sell this vehicle, you should advise the buyer that this safety recall was not performed on the vehicle and that the recall repair is still available. This notice should also be placed in the glove box so that a future owner of this vehicle will be aware of this safety recall. <br><br> <br></div>
