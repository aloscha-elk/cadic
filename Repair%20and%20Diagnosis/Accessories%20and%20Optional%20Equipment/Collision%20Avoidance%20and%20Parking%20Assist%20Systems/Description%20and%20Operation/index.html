<h1>Collision Avoidance and Parking Assist Systems: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>OBJECT DETECTION DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION</b><br><br><b>ULTRASONIC REAR PARK ASSIST OPERATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The ultrasonic rear park assist system senses how close the vehicle is to an object. The distance is determined by the 4 object sensors located in the rear bumper. The object detection system will notify the driver when backing up at speeds less than <b>8 km/h (5 mph)</b>. The object detection system will use the rear parking assist (RPA) display and the radio speakers for notification.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the ignition is ON and the vehicle is placed into reverse, the object detection system performs a bulb check. During the bulb check, the 3 indicators on the RPA will illuminate for approximately <b>2 seconds</b> to indicate that the system is working. The object detection system performs a bulb check and operates when the following conditions are present:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition is ON.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle is placed in REVERSE (R) for rear parking aid.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle speed is less than <b>5 km/h (3 mph)</b>. At speeds greater than <b>5 km/h (3 mph)</b>, the object detection system is disabled. The red indicator flashes to warn the driver that the object detection system is disabled.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The object detection system senses how close the vehicle is to an object. The distance is determined by the 4 object sensors located on the rear bumper. When the system detects an object, one of the following will occur:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the object is less than <b>0.3 m (11 in)</b> away from the vehicle, the amber outside, amber middle, and the red outside indicators flash and the chime sounds continuously.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the object is less than <b>0.3-0.5 m (11-20 in)</b> away from the vehicle, the amber outside, amber middle, and the red outside indicators are ON and the chime sounds continuously.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the object is <b>0.5-1.0 m (20-40 in)</b> away from the vehicle, the amber outside, and the amber middle indicators are ON.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the object is <b>1-2.3 m (40-91 in)</b> away from the vehicle, the amber outside indicator is ON and the chime sounds one time on the first detection of an object.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Object detection system can detect objects <b>7.6 cm (3 in)</b> wide and at least <b>25.4 cm (10 in)</b> tall. It cannot detect objects above the level of the roof.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If the object detection system detects a malfunction, a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) will be stored and the object detection system will send a serial data communication message to the instrument panel (I/P) to scroll SERVICE PARK ASSIST message on the driver information center (DIC). Then the chime will sound and the red indicator on the information telltale center will flash continuously, notifying the driver that a malfunction exists.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Each object sensor is a three wire sensor that is both a transmitter and a receiver that comprises a signal circuit, a low reference circuit, and an <b>8-volt</b> supply voltage circuit. The rear object control module supplies <b>8 volts</b> to the object sensors via the object sensor supply voltage circuit and provides ground via the low reference circuit. The rear object control module triggers the sensors in a sequential loop and after each sensor transmits, the rear object control module uses the echo or signal return to calculate the distance and position of an object from the rear bumper. The rear object control module directly controls the RPA display.<br><br><b><a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Accessories%2520and%2520Optional%2520Equipment/Collision%2520Avoidance%2520and%2520Parking%2520Assist%2520Systems/Rear%2520Vision%2520Camera/index.html">REAR VISION CAMERA</a> SYSTEM OPERATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The rear vision system can help a driver determine how close an object is to the rear bumper within a predefined rearward field of view. The system is composed of a video <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Camera/">camera</a> located on the rear liftgate, rear view camera image display module, electrical harness and the image display located on the radio.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The rear view <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Camera/">camera</a> image display module receives an active high (<b>12-volt)</b> signal from the body control module (BCM) when the vehicle is shifted into reverse. With the transmission is in the reverse, the rear view camera image display module will supply the camera with a regulated <b>6-volt</b> power source. The rear view camera image display module also serves to process the video information from the camera and deliver it to the radio. The image from the rear view camera will only be displayed in the radio when the vehicle is in reverse.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The radio can display the following rear vision error messages:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Accessories%2520and%2520Optional%2520Equipment/Collision%2520Avoidance%2520and%2520Parking%2520Assist%2520Systems/Rear%2520Vision%2520Camera/index.html">Rear Vision Camera</a> System Unavailable-This message may display when the system is not receiving information it requires from other vehicle systems.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Service <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Accessories%2520and%2520Optional%2520Equipment/Collision%2520Avoidance%2520and%2520Parking%2520Assist%2520Systems/Rear%2520Vision%2520Camera/index.html">Rear Vision Camera</a> System-This message may display when the system is not receiving video from the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Accessories%20and%20Optional%20Equipment/Camera/">camera</a>.</div>
