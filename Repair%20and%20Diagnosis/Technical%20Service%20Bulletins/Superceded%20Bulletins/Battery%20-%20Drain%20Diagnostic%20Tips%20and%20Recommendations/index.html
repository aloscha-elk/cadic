Generally, an intermittent is caused by faulty electrical connections and wiring, malfunctioning components or aftermarket equipment. The purpose of this bulletin is to provide the technician with the following diagnostic tips and/or recommendations that may prove to be beneficial in locating and repairing the condition.<br><br>Normally a draw, which takes the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Starting%20and%20Charging/Battery/">battery</a> level down overnight after operating the vehicle the day before, is rather large and may be related to a switch, relay or other electric/mechanical device. A small battery draw, which takes several days to take the battery to a low state of charge or below the level required to start the engine, may be a bulb or module staying on.<br><br>Customer Questions<br><br>Check for diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) and question the customer regarding the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Starting%20and%20Charging/Battery/">battery</a> drain.<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>How long does it take for the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Starting%20and%20Charging/Battery/">battery</a> to discharge?
