<h1>A/C - Musty Odors Emitted From (HVAC) System</h1><b>TECHNICAL</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.: </b>99-01-39-004D<br><br><b>Date: </b>August 10, 2011<br><br><b>Subject: </b>Air Conditioning Odor (Install <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Evaporator%2520Core/index.html">Evaporator Core</a> Dryer Kit and Apply Cooling Coil Coating)<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2012 and Prior GM Passenger Cars and Trucks<br>All Equipped with Air Conditioning<br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to add the 2011 and 2012 model years. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 99-01-39-004C (Section 01 - HVAC).<br><br><b>Condition</b><br><br>Some customers may comment about musty odors emitted from the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system at vehicle start-up in hot, humid conditions.<br><br><b>Cause</b><br><br>This condition may be caused by condensate build-up on the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Evaporator%2520Core/index.html">evaporator core</a>, which does not evaporate by itself in high humidity conditions. The odor may be the result of microbial growth on the evaporator core. When the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Blower%2520Motor/index.html">blower motor</a> fan is turned on, the microbial growth may release an unpleasant musty odor into the passenger compartment.<br><br>There are several other possible sources of a musty odor in a vehicle. A common source is a water leak into the interior of the vehicle or foreign material in the HVAC air distribution system. Follow the procedures in SI for identifying and correcting water leaks and air inlet inspection.<br><br>The procedure contained in this bulletin is only applicable if the odor source has been determined to be microbial growth on the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Evaporator%2520Core/index.html">evaporator core</a> inside the HVAC module.<br><br><b>Correction</b><br><br>Many vehicles currently incorporate an afterblow function within the HVAC control module software. The afterblow feature, when enabled, employs the HVAC blower fan to dry the evaporator after vehicle shut down and this function will inhibit microbial growth. Technicians are to confirm that the customer concern is <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Evaporator%2520Core/index.html">evaporator core</a> odor and that the vehicle has the imbedded afterblow feature, as defined in the SI document for that specific vehicle model, model year and specific HVAC option. Refer to SI for enabling the afterblow function. Vehicles being delivered in areas prone to high humidity conditions may benefit from having the afterblow enabled calibration installed prior to any customer comment.<br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>If the vehicle is not factory equipped with the imbedded afterblow enable feature, it may be added with the Electronic Evaporator Dryer Module Kit (P/N 12497910 or AC Delco 15-5876).</b><br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>When installing the Electronic Evaporator Dryer Module, you MUST</b> use the included electrical splice connectors to ensure a proper splice. Complete detailed installation instructions and self testing procedures are supplied with the kit. If necessary, the Electronic Evaporator Dryer Module may be installed underhood if it is protected from extreme heat and water splash areas.<br><br>To immediately remove the <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Evaporator%2520Core/index.html">evaporator core</a> odor on all suspect vehicles, it is necessary to eliminate the microbial growth and prevent its re-occurrence.
