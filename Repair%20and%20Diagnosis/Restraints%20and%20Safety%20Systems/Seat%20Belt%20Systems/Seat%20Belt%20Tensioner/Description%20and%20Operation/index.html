<h1>Seat Belt Tensioner: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>SEAT BELT PRETENSIONER</b><br><br>The seat belt pretensioner consist of a housing, a <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Restraints%2520and%2520Safety%2520Systems/Seat%2520Belt%2520Systems/Seat%2520Belt%2520Retractor/index.html">seat belt retractor</a>, the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Restraints%2520and%2520Safety%2520Systems/Seat%2520Belt%2520Systems/Seat%2520Belt/index.html">seat belt</a> webbing, an initiator, and a canister of gas generating materials. The initiator is part of the seat belt pretensioner deployment loop. When the vehicle is involved in a collision of sufficient force, the sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) causes current to flow through the seat belt deployment loops to the initiator. Current passing through the initiator ignites the material in the canister producing a rapid generation of gas. The gas produced from this reaction deploys the seat belt pretensioner and retracts the seat belt webbing, which removes all of the slack in the seat belts. Depending on the severity of the collision, the seat belt pretensioner may deploy without the frontal inflator modules deploying, or they will deploy immediately before the frontal inflator modules deploy. Each seat belt pretensioner is equipped with a shorting bar that is located in the connector of the seat belt pretensioner. The shorting bar shorts the seat belt pretensioner circuitry to prevent unwanted deployment of the seat belt pretensioner when the connector is disconnected.</div>
