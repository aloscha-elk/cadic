<h1>Testing for Intermittent Conditions and Poor Connections</h1><br><br><b>TESTING FOR INTERMITTENT CONDITIONS AND POOR CONNECTIONS</b><br><br><b>TOOLS REQUIRED</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>J 35616 GM-Approved Terminal Test Kit<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>J-38125 Terminal Repair Kit<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the condition is not currently present, but is indicated in DTC history, the cause may be intermittent. An intermittent may also be the cause when there is a customer complaint, but the symptom cannot be duplicated. Refer to the Symptom Table of the system that is suspect of causing the condition before trying to locate an intermittent condition.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Most intermittent conditions are caused by faulty electrical connections or wiring. Inspect for the following items:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wiring broken inside the insulation<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Poor connection between the male and female terminal at a connector<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Poor terminal to wire connection-Some conditions which fall under this description are poor crimps, poor solder joints, crimping over the wire insulation rather than the wire itself, and corrosion in the wire to terminal contact area, etc.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pierced or damaged insulation can allow moisture to enter the wiring causing corrosion. The conductor can corrode inside the insulation, with little visible evidence. Look for swollen and stiff sections of wire in the suspect circuits.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wiring which has been pinched, cut, or its insulation rubbed through may cause an intermittent open or short as the bare area touches other wiring or parts of the vehicle.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wiring that comes in contact with hot or exhaust components<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Refer to Inducing Intermittent Fault Conditions in order to duplicate the conditions required, in order to verify the customer concern.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Refer to Testing for Electrical Intermittents for test procedures to detect intermittent open, high resistance, short to ground, and short to voltage conditions.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Refer to Scan Tool Snapshot Procedure for advanced intermittent diagnosis and Vehicle Data Recorder operation.<br><br><b>TESTING FOR PROPER TERMINAL CONTACT</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>It is important to test terminal contact at the component and any inline connectors before replacing a suspect component. Mating terminals must be inspected to ensure good terminal contact. A poor connection between the male and female terminal at a connector may be the result of contamination or deformation.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Contamination may be caused by the connector halves being improperly connected. A missing or damaged connector seal, damage to the connector itself, or exposing the terminals to moisture and dirt can also cause contamination. Contamination, usually in the underhood or underbody connectors, leads to terminal corrosion, causing an open circuit or intermittently open circuit.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Deformation is caused by probing the mating side of a connector terminal without the proper adapter. Always use the J 35616 when probing connectors. Other causes of terminal deformation are improperly joining the connector halves, or repeatedly separating and joining the connector halves. Deformation, usually to the female terminal contact tang, can result in poor terminal contact causing an open or intermittently open circuit.<br><br><b>TESTING FOR PROPER TERMINAL CONTACT IN BUSSED ELECTRICAL CENTERS (BEC)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>It is very important to use the correct test adapter when testing for proper terminal contact of fuses and relays in a bussed electrical center (BEC). Use J-35616-35 to test for proper terminal contact. Failure to use J-35616-35 can result in improper diagnosis of the BEC.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Follow the procedure below in order to test terminal contact:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Separate the connector halves.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Visually inspect the connector halves for contamination. Contamination may result in a white or green build-up within the connector body or between terminals. This causes high terminal resistance, intermittent contact, or an open circuit. An underhood or underbody connector that shows signs of contamination should be replaced in its entirety: terminals, seals, and connector body.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Using an equivalent male terminal from the J-38125, test that the retention force is significantly different between a good terminal and a suspect terminal. Replace the female terminal in question.<br><br><b>FLAT WIRE (DOCK AND LOCK) CONNECTORS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>There are no serviceable parts for flat wire (dock and lock) connectors on the harness side or the component side.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Follow the procedure below in order to test terminal contact:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the component in question.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Visually inspect each side of the connector for signs of contamination. Avoid touching either side of the connector as oil from your skin may be a source of contamination as well.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Visually inspect the terminal bearing surfaces of the flat wire circuits for splits, cracks, or other imperfections that could cause poor terminal contact. Visually inspect the component side connector to ensure that all of the terminals are uniform and free of damage or deformation.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Insert the appropriate adapter from the on the flat wire harness connector in order to test the circuit in question.<br><br><b>CONTROL MODULE/COMPONENT VOLTAGE AND GROUNDS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Poor voltage or ground connections can cause widely varying symptoms.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Test all control module voltage supply circuits. Many vehicles have multiple circuits supplying voltage to a control module. Other components in the system may have separate voltage supply circuits that may also need to be tested. Inspect connections at the module/component connectors, fuses, and any intermediate connections between the voltage source and the module/component. A test lamp or a DMM may indicate that voltage is present, but neither tests the ability of the circuit to carry sufficient current. Ensure that the circuit can carry the current necessary to operate the component. Refer to Circuit Testing and Power Distribution Schematics.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Test all control module ground and system ground circuits. The control module may have multiple ground circuits. Other components in the system may have separate grounds that may also need to be tested. Inspect grounds for clean and tight connections at the grounding point. Inspect the connections at the component and in splice packs, where applicable. Ensure that the circuit can carry the current necessary to operate the component. Refer to Circuit Testing and Ground Distribution Schematics.<br><br><b>TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>An intermittent condition may occur when a component/connection reaches normal operating temperature. The condition may occur only when the component/connection is cold, or only when the component/connection is hot.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Freeze Frame, Failure Records, Snapshot, or Vehicle Data Recorder data may help with this type of intermittent condition, where applicable.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the intermittent is related to heat, review the data for a relationship with the following:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>High ambient temperatures<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Underhood/engine generated heat<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Circuit generated heat due to a poor connection, or high electrical load<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Higher than normal load conditions, towing, etc.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the intermittent is related to cold, review the data for the following:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Low ambient temperatures-In extremely low temperatures, ice may form in a connection or component. Inspect for water intrusion.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The condition only occurs on a cold start.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The condition goes away when the vehicle warms up.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Information from the customer may help to determine if the trouble follows a pattern that is temperature related.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If temperature is suspected of causing an intermittent fault condition, attempt to duplicate the condition. Refer to Inducing Intermittent Fault Conditions in order to duplicate the conditions required.<br><br><b>ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE (EMI) AND ELECTRICAL NOISE</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Some electrical components/circuits are sensitive to electromagnetic interference (EMI) or other types of electrical noise. Inspect for the following conditions:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A misrouted harness that is too close to high voltage/high current devices such as secondary ignition components, motors, generator etc-These components may induce electrical noise on a circuit that could interfere with normal circuit operation.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Electrical system interference caused by a malfunctioning relay, or a control module driven solenoid or switch-These conditions can cause a sharp electrical surge. Normally, the condition will occur when the malfunctioning component is operating.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Improper installation of non-factory or aftermarket add on accessories such as lights, 2-way radios, amplifiers, electric motors, remote starters, alarm systems, cell phones, etc-These accessories may lead to interference while in use, but do not fail when the accessories are not in use.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Test for an open diode across the A/C compressor clutch and for other open diodes. Some relays may contain a clamping diode.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The generator may be allowing AC noise into the electrical system.<br><br><b>INCORRECT CONTROL MODULE</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>There are only a few situations where reprogramming a control module is appropriate:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>A new service control module is installed.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>A control module from another vehicle is installed.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Revised software/calibration files have been released for this vehicle.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that the control module contains the correct software/calibration. If incorrect programming is found, reprogram the control module with the most current software/calibration. Refer to Control Module References for replacement, setup, and programming.  <a href="../../../../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  DO NOT re-program the control module with the SAME software/calibration files that are already present in the control module. This is not an effective repair for any type of concern.</div>
