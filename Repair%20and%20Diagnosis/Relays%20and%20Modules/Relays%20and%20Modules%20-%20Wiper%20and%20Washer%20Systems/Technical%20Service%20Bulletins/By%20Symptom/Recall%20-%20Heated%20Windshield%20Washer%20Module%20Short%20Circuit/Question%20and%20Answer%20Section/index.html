<h1>Question and Answer Section</h1><b>Question and Answer Section</b><br><br>Q1. Why are we compensating customers for a recall? <br><br>A1. This is a special case where we are not confident a repair would work. This is why we are removing this feature from the vehicle. Compensating the current customer of record for this loss is an appropriate gesture. <br><br>Q2. What is the original cost of the Heated Washer Fluid System? <br><br>A2. The system was priced in several ways; as standard equipment, as a stand-alone option and as part of an option package. We analyzed these scenarios and determined that $100 is an appropriate estimate of the value of the feature. <br><br>Q3. How much will each customer receive? <br><br>A3. Customers will receive a $100 check from their servicing dealer within 30 days of recall completion. <br><br>Q4. Why can't GM issue the checks? <br><br>A4. Due to their age, our original sales records will not reflect any subsequent vehicle transactions or owner changes. Additionally, we don't have an in-house system that can handle this number of checks. So we are depending on our dealers to help execute this safety recall. <br><br>Q5: When will customers be notified about having this feature disabled? <br><br>A5: Customers should begin receiving letters in the mail in mid-June. However, they can go to their local dealer any time (even in advance of receiving a letter) to have the system disabled. <br><br>Q6. Are all of the VINs involved in this recall identified in the GWM-IVH (GMVIS2) application? <br><br>A6. Yes, all involved VINs have been updated for this recall. <br><br>Q7. How do I identify the current customer of record? <br><br>A7. For the purposes of this recall, the current customer of record is to be identified as the person or company whose name appears on the vehicle's state registration document or other legally recognized proof of vehicle ownership (unless specifically excluded). Prior to issuing the $100.00 check, please ensure the proof of ownership documentation has not expired and is otherwise valid. <br><br>Q8. What should I do if proof of vehicle ownership is not available? <br><br>A8. If proof of vehicle ownership documentation is not currently available or is otherwise invalid, the $100 check should not be issued. <br><br>Q9. What if the customer objects to this policy? <br><br>A9. If valid proof of ownership documentation is not available, the decision not to issue the $100 check is correct. If the customer still disagrees, please refer him/her to the GM Customer Assistance Center. <br><br>Q10. If a check is not issued, how should the recall claim be submitted? <br><br>A10. If a final determination is made not to issue a check, the $100 net item amount should not be claimed. Only the labor cost for the repair should be submitted. <br><br>Q11. Can you provide examples of the various customer scenarios I can expect? <br><br>A11. Certainly, listed below are examples with the preferred resolution. <br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Retail Customer - Vehicle Purchased <br><br>Issue check to the customer at vehicle pickup if valid proof of vehicle ownership documentation is available. All checks must include the complete 17 character Vehicle Identification Number. <br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Retail Customer - Vehicle Leased <br><br>Issue check to the customer at vehicle pickup (not GMAC or other financial institution) if valid proof of vehicle ownership documentation is available. All checks must include the complete 17 character Vehicle Identification Number. <br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Fleet Customer - Daily Rental (Avis, Budget, Enterprise, etc.) <br><br>Issue check to the daily rental company if valid proof of vehicle ownership documentation is available. Confirm local address and mail or provide check to their representative at vehicle pickup. All checks must include the complete 17 character Vehicle Identification Number. <br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Fleet Customer - Lease Management Company (PH&H, GE Capital, ARI, etc.) <br><br>Issue check to the lease management company if valid proof of ownership documentation is available. Ask the customer where the check should be mailed. Approximately 7,500 vehicles are involved and these customers will be receiving a letter from their lease management company explaining this situation. All checks must include the complete 17 character Vehicle Identification Number. <br><br>Q12. What should I do if a customer refuses to have the recall service procedure performed on his/her vehicle? <br><br>A12. If a customer initially declines the recall repair, please make sure that he/she fully understands the possible consequences. <br></div>
