It is important to keep the upholstery from becoming heavily soiled. The vehicle's interior can experience extreme heat, which can cause stains to set quickly. Lighter color interiors may require more frequent cleaning. Care should be taken because newspapers and garments may transfer color to the vehicle's interior.<br><br>Many of today's interiors are made with new low gloss materials. Permanent damage may result from using cleaners on ANY surfaces (interior trim, instrument panel, <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Interior%2520Moulding%2520%252F%2520Trim/Carpet/index.html">carpet</a>, leather, vinyl and fabric) for which they are not intended.

The increase in gloss may cause annoying reflections in the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Windows%20and%20Glass/Windshield/">windshield</a> and even make it difficult to see through the windshield under certain conditions.</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Never use a STIFF brush or a brush that has been previously used with a harsh chemical.

These products are in the neutral-pH range and will maintain the best vehicle interior appearance. These products are water-based, biodegradable, and do not contain bleach, solvents or harsh chemicals. <br><br>Interior trim pieces on new vehicles, as well as service components, arrive with a protective film.

The chart lists many of the common stains. Some complex stains may require the application of both stain removers, one after the other, to remove both food-based oils and synthetic oils.<br><br>A soft bristle brush (P/N 88861425) should be used to safely work the cleaner into the leather grain or material. This enables the dirt/stain to be completely removed from the material.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/632967375.png"></div><br><br><br><br><b>Leather Conditioner/Restorer</b><br><br>A Leather Conditioner/Restorer is also available. The restorer is safe for all vinyl and leather. It is a water-based product and contains essential emollients to restore suppleness, conditions and adds luster without adding gloss. The restorer will also provide protection against re-staining.<br><br><b>Dye Transfer: </b> Dye transfer will happen any time a natural fiber like cotton, silk, wool, or suede comes into contact with leather. The lighter the leather color, the more quickly the dye transfer will appear. Leather should be cleaned on a regular basis so that the dirt and grime do not adversely affect the top coat of the leather. After cleaning the leather, it is important to treat the surface with the restorer. <br><br><b>Extractor Machine and Concentrate</b><br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>The concentrate may not yet be available for Saab and/or Saturn Dealers. The product can be obtained from a General Motors dealership until such time it is available through Saab and/or Saturn Parts Departments.</b><br><br>For difficult to clean materials or when cleaning a large area, the best results will be achieved when using an extractor machine and concentrate. General Motors offers the Ruby Extractor (P/N 627-CC-3000AU) through GM Tools and Equipment 1-800-GM-TOOLS, and has recently released a concentrate for use with the extractor machine.<br><br>Whichever extractor machine is used, it should meet the minimum specifications of the Ruby Extractor:<br><br><b>Ruby Extractor Specifications:</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pump PSI: 55 <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Water Lift: 85" <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Hose Length: 10 ft <br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>The Ruby Extractor also comes with a 6 year Outer Body and 3 year Parts warranty.</b><br><br><b>Extractor:</b> The Ruby Extractor machine was designed for automotive use and works effectively in the vehicle's interior. The narrow design of the vacuum head allows detail work in tight areas. The water pressure pump is reduced so the fabric surface is not wet more than is necessary. The dry time is greatly reduced due to less water on the fabric surface, the vacuum head making better contact with the surface and the significant water lift capability of the machine.<br><br><b>Concentrate:</b> The concentrated extraction cleaner is engineered with lower pH levels to help remove alkaline buildup on fabrics. The concentrate should be mixed according to the instructions listed on the container. The available concentrate helps to break the stain down and then the stain is easily removed with less water. The concentrate used in the Ruby Extractor is slightly acidic to remove soap and alkalinity from the fabric surfaces left behind by using improper, soapy solutions. Dirt, grease and grime are more easily removed when the proper solution is used during the extraction process.<br><br><b>Parts Information</b><br><br>Products are available in two sizes; 8 oz / 235 ML and 24 oz / 710 ML bottles.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/632973212.png"></div><br><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/632977051.png"></div><br><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/632977659.png"></div><br><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/632978724.png"></div><br><br><br><br><b>Available Equipment</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/632980495.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Equipment is available by contacting 1-800-GMTOOLS.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br><br></div>
