The GM Approved Refinish Materials book GM P/N GM4901M-D-2004 identifies the paint systems you may use. Always refer to the latest revision of the 4901M-D book. All approved products, including volatile organic compound (VOC) compliant regulations are listed in the system approach recommended by the individual manufacturer. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for the detailed procedures for materials used in the paint system in the painting repairs of rigid exterior surfaces. All components of an approved paint system have been engineered in order to ensure proper adhesion between layers.<br><br>If necessary, spot repairs or color blending in an open panel can be done. However, do not blend clearcoat in an open panel.
