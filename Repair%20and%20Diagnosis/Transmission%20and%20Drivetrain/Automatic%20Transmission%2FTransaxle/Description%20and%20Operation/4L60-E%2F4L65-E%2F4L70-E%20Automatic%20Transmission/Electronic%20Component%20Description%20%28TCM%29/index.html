The two-element transducer functions as an on/off switch by sensing changes in the magnetic field strength. The dual element design greatly increases the sensor's switching accuracy.<br><br>Because the turbine shaft is splined to the torque converter, it spins at engine speed. As the turbine shaft spins, the rotor teeth pass in front of the sensor tip, changing the magnetic field. As a result, the transducers are sensing high and low magnetic signals. The IC chip will then amplify and filter the high and low signal. Therefore, whenever the engine is running, the sensor will produce high and low signals proportional to turbine shaft speed. The more rotor teeth passing by the sensor's magnetic field in a specific amount of time, the faster the turbine shaft is spinning.<br><br>The ISS assembly is attached to the pump cover with the tip of the sensor passing though the stator shaft and sleeve. The ISS mounting bolt passes through a steel insert and into a threaded hole in the pump cover. The ISS wiring harness is routed and secured to the pump cover with clip-on brackets. At the transmission control module (TCM), the signal is electronically converted and is interpreted as transmission input speed.
