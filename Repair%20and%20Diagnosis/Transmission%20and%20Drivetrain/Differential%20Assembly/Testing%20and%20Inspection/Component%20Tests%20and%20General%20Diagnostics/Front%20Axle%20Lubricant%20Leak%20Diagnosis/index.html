<h1>Front Axle Lubricant Leak Diagnosis</h1><br><br><b>Front Axle Lubricant Leak Diagnosis</b><br><br>Front axle lubricant leaks can occur at the following locations:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Drive%2520Axles%252C%2520Bearings%2520and%2520Joints/Axle%2520Shaft%2520Assembly/Axle%2520Shaft/index.html">Axle shaft</a> oil seals<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Differential carrier assembly mating surface<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drain plug<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fill plug<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inner axle tube assembly to differential carrier assembly mating surface<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pinion yoke oil seal<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vent tube<br><br><b>Determining the Cause</b><br><br>While most front axle leaks may be easy to find, determining the cause may not be. A thorough inspection of the area around the leak may assist in determining the cause of the leak.<br><br><b>Oil Seals</b><br><br>Lubricant leaks from a oil seal may be caused by any of the following:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>An improperly installed seal<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A distorted seal<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A worn seal<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A worn shaft<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A brittle seal lip<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A hardened seal lip<br><br>To determine the actual cause of the leak, clean the area around the leak. Observe the area of the leak and determine the if the seal or another component is causing the leak. A worn seal surface will cause a leak at the sealing lip while a misaligned seal or a seal installed into a housing with an excessive bore will cause the seal to leak at the outside surface of the seal. Hardened or cracked seal lips usually indicate the axle is operating beyond the normal temperature limits for the axle. A seal whose sealing surface has been nicked or cut may indicate that the shaft has a rough, burred, or gouged surface and will need to be inspected before the seal can be replaced.<br><br><b>Sealing Surfaces</b><br><br>Front axles components are assembled using specific sealers. A leak at a surface sealed with sealant is usually caused by a poor fit of the components but can also be caused by the use of the wrong sealant. When correcting a sealant leak, inspect each component for distortion and for nicks or gouges that may prohibit the sealant from sealing properly and when re-assembling the component, use the proper sealant.<br><br><b>Differential Carrier Assembly</b><br><br>Lubricant leaks at the differential carrier assembly can occur at the following locations:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Drain Plug<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Fill Plug<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vent tube<br><br>Drain and fill plug leaks are usually caused by a loose plug. A vent tube leak can be cause by a loose fitting vent hose or by a vent tube assembly whose interior shield is stuck in the upside down position. Inspect the vent plug's interior shield for unrestricted movement, repair or replace the plug as necessary. Drain or fill plug leaks can be repaired by either tightening the plug or by using an approved sealer on the threads on the plug.<br><br></div>
