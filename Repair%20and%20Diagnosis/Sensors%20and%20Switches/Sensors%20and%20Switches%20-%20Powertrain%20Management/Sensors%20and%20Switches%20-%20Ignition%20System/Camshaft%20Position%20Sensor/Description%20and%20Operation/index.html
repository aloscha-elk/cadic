<h1>Camshaft Position Sensor: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>CAMSHAFT ACTUATOR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</b><br><br><b>CAMSHAFT POSITION (CMP) ACTUATOR SYSTEM</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The camshaft (CMP) actuator system is an electro-hydraulic operated device used for a variety of engine performance and operational enhancements. These enhancements include lower emission output through exhaust gas dilution of the intake charge in the combustion chamber, a broader engine torque range, and improved fuel economy. The CMP actuator system accomplishes this by, changing the angle or timing of the camshaft, relative to the crankshaft position. The CMP actuator simply allows earlier or later intake and exhaust valve opening, during the four stroke engine cycle. The CMP actuator cannot vary the duration of valve opening, or the valve lift.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>During engine OFF, engine idling conditions, and engine shutdown, the camshaft actuator is held in the park position. Internal to the CMP actuator assembly is a return spring and a locking pin. During non-phasing modes of the camshaft, the return spring rotates the camshaft back to the park position, and the locking pin retains the CMP actuator sprocket to the camshaft. For the Gen IV small block engines, the park position for the CMP actuator and camshaft is, <b>8.5 degrees</b> before top dead center (BTDC), which is equal to <b>17 crankshaft degrees</b> BTDC, to the next cylinder in firing order. The engine control module (ECM) can only command the CMP actuator to retard the valve timing from the park position, or advance the valve timing back to the park position. The total range of valve timing authority is <b>31 degrees</b> of camshaft rotation, which is equal to <b>62 degrees</b> of crankshaft rotation. The control range is from the park position of <b>8.5 degrees camshaft, or 17 degrees</b> of crankshaft BTDC, to <b>22.5 degrees</b> camshaft, or <b>45 degrees</b> crankshaft, after top dead center (ATDC).<br><br><b>CMP ACTUATOR SYSTEM OPERATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The camshaft position (CMP) actuator system is controlled by the engine control module (ECM). The ECM sends a pulse width modulated, <b>12-volt</b> signal to the CMP actuator solenoid to control the amount of pressurized engine oil, into the CMP actuator. A low reference circuit, or ground wire between the CMP actuator solenoid and the ECM completes the electrical circuit. The frequency of the pulse width modulated signal is fixed at <b>150 Hz</b>. To regulate the pressurized engine oil into the CMP actuator, the solenoid uses electromagnetic force on the solenoid pintle to pulse the oil control spool valve. The pressurized engine oil is sent to unseat the locking pin, and to the vane and rotor assembly of the CMP actuator, to either retard or advance the valve timing. The ECM will control the amount of ON time applied to the solenoid, through the <b>12-volt</b> signal from the ECM.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The ECM uses the following inputs before assuming control of the CMP actuator, and to calculate the optimum valve timing.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine speed<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Manifold absolute pressure (<a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Manifold%2520Pressure%252FVacuum%2520Sensor/index.html">MAP</a>)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Throttle position angle<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Camshaft position sensor (CMP)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Crankshaft position sensor (CKP)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Crankshaft/camshaft correlation<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine coolant temperature (ECT)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Closed loop fuel control<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine oil pressure (EOP)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine oil level<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>CMP actuator solenoid circuit state<br><br><b>CMP ACTUATOR SOLENOID CIRCUIT DIAGNOSTICS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The engine control module (ECM) monitors the control circuit of the camshaft position (CMP) actuator solenoid for electrical faults. The control module has the ability to determine if a control circuit is open, shorted high, or shorted low. If the control module detects a fault with the CMP actuator solenoid control circuit, DTC P0010 will set.<br><br><b>CMP ACTUATOR SYSTEM PERFORMANCE DIAGNOSTIC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The engine control module (ECM) monitors the performance of the camshaft position (CMP) actuator system by monitoring the calibrated desired position, and the actual position of the camshaft, through the 4X signal of the CMP sensor. If the difference between the actual and desired position is greater than a calibrated angle, for more than a calibrated amount of time, DTC P0011 will set.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>For the system descriptions covering the hydraulic/mechanical part of the CMP actuator refer to Camshaft Position (CMP) Actuator and Solenoid Valve DESCRIPTION.</div>
