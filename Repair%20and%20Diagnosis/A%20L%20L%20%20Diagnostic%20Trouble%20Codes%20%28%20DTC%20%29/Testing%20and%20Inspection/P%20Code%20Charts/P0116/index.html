The engine control module (ECM) supplies <b>5 volts</b> to the ECT signal circuit and supplies a ground to the low reference circuit.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The ECM uses this high side coolant rationality diagnostic to determine if the input from the ECT sensor is skewed warmer than normal. The internal clock of the ECM will record the amount of time the ignition is OFF. If the calibrated ignition OFF time is met at start-up, the ECM will compare the temperature difference between the ECT and the intake air temperature (IAT), to determine if the temperatures are within an acceptable operating range of each other.<br><br><b>CONDITIONS FOR RUNNING THE DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DTCs P0112, P0113, P0117, P0118, P0502, P0503, P0601, P0603, P062F, P2610 are not set.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle has had a minimum ignition OFF time of <b>10 hours</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition is ON.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The start-up IAT is more than <b>-7&deg;C (+19&deg;F)</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The Fuel Level Sensor parameter is more than <b>5 percent</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>This DTC runs once per ignition cycle within the enabling conditions.<br><br><b>CONDITIONS FOR SETTING THE DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ECM detects a temperature difference at power-up that indicates that the ECT sensor is <b>30&deg;C (54&deg;F)</b> more than the IAT sensor. OR<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ECM detects a temperature difference at power-up that indicates that the ECT sensor is <b>10&deg;C (18&deg;F)</b> more than the IAT sensor, and the time spent cranking the engine is more than <b>10 seconds</b>, when the fuel level is more than <b>5 percent</b>. OR<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>With the power-up IAT more than <b>-7&deg;C (+19&deg;F)</b>, the ECM detects a temperature difference at power-up that indicates that the ECT sensor is <b>20&deg;C (36&deg;F)</b> more than the IAT sensor. Then the vehicle must be driven for more than <b>6 minutes</b> and <b>40 seconds</b> at more than <b>40 km/h (25 mph)</b>. If the IAT sensor then decreases more than <b>4&deg;C (7&deg;F)</b>, an engine block heater was detected and the test is aborted. If the IAT sensor does not decrease, an engine block heater was not detected and DTC P0116 will set.<br><br><b>ACTION TAKEN WHEN THE DTC SETS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>DTC P0116 is a Type B DTC.<br><br><b>CONDITIONS FOR CLEARING THE MIL/DTC</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>DTC P0116 is a Type B DTC.<br><br><b>CIRCUIT/SYSTEM VERIFICATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the ignition has been OFF for <b>8 hours</b> or more, the ECT and the IAT, should be within <b>6&deg;C (11&deg;F)</b> of each other and also the ambient temperature. Turn ON the ignition, with the engine OFF, and use a scan tool to observe the IAT and the ECT sensor parameters. Compare those sensor parameters to each other and also to the ambient temperature. A slight to moderate resistance in the IAT signal or low reference circuit, can widen the spread between the two sensors and cause this DTC to set.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>An IAT sensor that is skewed lower at various ambient temperatures, due to more resistance than is normal, can widen the spread between the two sensors and cause this DTC to set. Measure and record the resistance of the IAT sensor at various ambient temperatures, and then compare those measurements to the Temperature vs Resistance Table. Refer to Temperature Versus Resistance.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the ECT sensor terminals for corrosion, and for engine coolant leaking through the sensor.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>CAUTION:  Under pressure, the temperature of the solution in the radiator can be considerably higher, without boiling. Removing the radiator cap while the engine is hot (pressure is high), will cause the solution to boil instantaneously, with explosive force. The solution will spew out over the engine, fenders, and the person removing the cap. Serious bodily injury may result. Flammable antifreeze, such as alcohol, is not recommended for use at any time. Flammable antifreeze could cause a serious fire.</b><br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Turn OFF the ignition.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the cooling system surge tank for the proper engine coolant level.
