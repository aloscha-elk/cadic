<h1>Ignition System: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>ELECTRONIC IGNITION (EI) SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</b><br><br>The electronic ignition (EI) system is responsible for producing and controlling a high energy secondary spark. This spark is used to ignite the compressed air/fuel mixture at precisely the correct time. This provides optimal performance, fuel economy, and control of exhaust emissions. This <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Ignition%20System/">ignition system</a> consists of a separate <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Ignition%2520System/Ignition%2520Coil/index.html">ignition coil</a> connected to each <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Tune-up%2520and%2520Engine%2520Performance%2520Checks/Spark%2520Plug/index.html">spark plug</a> by a short secondary wire. The driver modules within each coil assembly are commanded ON/OFF by the engine control module (ECM). The ECM primarily uses engine speed and position information from the crankshaft and camshaft position (CMP) sensors to control the sequence, dwell, and timing of the spark event. The EI system consists of the following components:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Crankshaft Reluctor Wheel</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The crankshaft reluctor wheel is part of the crankshaft. The reluctor wheel consists of 58 teeth and a reference gap. Each tooth on the reluctor wheel is spaced at <b>6 degrees</b> apart from each other, for a total of 60-tooth spacing around the circumference of the wheel. The crankshaft reluctor wheel is missing 2 of the 60 teeth. The 2 missing teeth are used to create <b>12 degrees</b> of spacing, which is used for the reference or sync pulse. The sync pulse is used by the engine control module (ECM) to synchronize the coil firing with the crankshaft position, while the other teeth provide cylinder location during each crankshaft revolution.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Crankshaft Position (CKP) Sensor</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The crankshaft position (CKP) sensor is a 3-wire sensor that provides a digital output signal. The wire circuits consist of an engine control module (ECM) supplied <b>5-volt</b> reference circuit, a low reference circuit between the CKP sensor and the ECM, and an output signal circuit from the CKP sensor to the ECM. The CKP sensor detects magnetic flux changes of the teeth and slots of the 58-tooth reluctor on the crankshaft. The CKP sensor provides an ON/OFF DC voltage of varying frequency, with 58 output pulses per each crankshaft revolution. The frequency of the CKP sensor output signal depends on the speed of the crankshaft. The CKP sensor sends a digital square wave signal, which represents an image of the teeth on the reluctor wheel, to the ECM. The <b>12 degree</b> reference gap on the reluctor wheel is used to identify crankshaft position. The CKP information, along with the camshaft position (CMP) sensor information is used to determine the correct time and sequence for fuel injection, ignition spark events, detect cylinder misfire, and the camshaft to crankshaft relative position.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Camshaft Reluctor Wheel</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The camshaft reluctor wheel is part of the camshaft gear. The reluctor wheel contains a pattern of 2 narrow teeth, and 2 wide teeth around the circumference of the wheel. The falling or trailing edges of the 4 teeth are evenly spaced at <b>90 degrees</b> apart. The engine control module (ECM) recognizes the narrow and wide tooth patterns to identify camshaft position, or which cylinder is in compression, and which is in exhaust. The ECM also uses the reluctor wheel information to determine the camshaft relative position to the crankshaft position.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Camshaft Position (CMP) Sensor</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The camshaft position (CMP) sensor is a 3-wire sensor that provides a digital output signal. The wire circuits consist of an engine control module (ECM) supplied <b>5-volt</b> reference circuit, a low reference circuit between the CMP sensor and the ECM, and an output signal circuit from the CMP sensor to the ECM. The CMP sensor detects magnetic flux changes between the teeth and slots on the 4-tooth reluctor wheel. The CMP sensor provides a digital ON/OFF DC voltage of varying frequency, with 4 varying width output pulses, per each camshaft revolution. The frequency of the CMP sensor output signal depends on the speed of the camshaft. The ECM will recognize the narrow and wide tooth patterns to identify camshaft position, or which cylinder is in compression and which is in exhaust. The information is then used to determine the correct time and sequence for fuel injection and ignition spark events. The ECM also uses the CMP sensor output signal to determine the camshaft relative position to the crankshaft position.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b><a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Ignition%2520System/Ignition%2520Coil/index.html">Ignition Coils</a></b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Each ignition coil has an ignition 1 voltage feed and a ground circuit. The engine control module (ECM) supplies a low reference and an ignition control (IC) circuit. Each ignition coil contains a solid state driver module. The ECM will command the IC circuit ON, which allows the current to flow through the primary coil windings for the appropriate time or dwell. When the ECM commands the IC circuit OFF, this will interrupt current flow through the primary coil windings. The magnetic field created by the primary coil windings will collapse across the secondary coil windings, which induces a high voltage across the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Tune-up%2520and%2520Engine%2520Performance%2520Checks/Spark%2520Plug/index.html">spark plug</a> electrodes. The primary coils are current limited to prevent overloading if the IC circuit is held ON for an extended time. The spark plugs are connected to their respective coils by a short secondary wire. The spark plugs are tipped with iridium for long life and efficiency.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Engine Control Module (ECM)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The engine control module (ECM) controls all <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Ignition%20System/">ignition system</a> functions, and constantly corrects the basic spark timing. The ECM monitors information from various sensor inputs that include the following:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The throttle position (TP) sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine coolant temperature (ECT) sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The mass air flow (MAF) sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The intake air temperature (IAT) sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle speed sensor (VSS)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The transmission gear position or range information sensors<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The engine <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Ignition%2520System/Knock%2520Sensor/index.html">knock sensors</a> (KS)<br><br><b>MODES OF OPERATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>There is one normal mode of operation, with the spark under engine control module (ECM) control. If the crankshaft position (CKP) pulses are lost, the engine will not run. The loss of a camshaft position (CMP) signal may result in a longer crank time, since the ECM cannot determine which stroke the pistons are on. Diagnostic trouble codes are available to accurately diagnose the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Ignition%20System/">ignition system</a> with a scan tool.</div>
