<h1>Cooling Fan Inoperative</h1><br><br><b>Cooling Fan Inoperative</b><br><br><b>Diagnostic Instructions</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Perform the Diagnostic System Check - Vehicle prior to using this diagnostic procedure. <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Initial%20Inspection%20and%20Diagnostic%20Overview/">Initial Inspection and Diagnostic Overview</a><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Strategy Based Diagnosis<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Diagnostic Procedure Instructions<br><br><b>Circuit/System Description</b><br><br>The engine control module (ECM) commands the fans ON in either high speed or low speed, depending on cooling requirements. In low speed, both fans are turned ON at a reduced speed. High speed has both fans turned ON at full speed.<br><br>In low speed operation, the ECM applies ground to the coil side of the fan low relay. This energizes the coil and applies voltage directly to the left cooling fan through the switch side of the fan low relay, which is fed by the fan 1 fuse. The right fan is connected in series to the left fan through the de-energized fan control relay so that both operate at low speed. <br><br>In high speed operation, the ECM applies a ground to the coil side of the fan low relay, the fan control relay, and the fan high relay. On the fan high relay, the energized coil closes the switch side of the relay and applies voltage directly to the right cooling fan through the switch side of the relay, which is fed by the fan 2 fuse. At the same time, the ECM energizes fan control relay pulling the switch side over, providing a direct path to ground for the left cooling fan, which has voltage applied through the energized fan low relay. In high speed mode, the fans are operated as a parallel circuit with full voltage applied to each. <br><br><b>Diagnostic Aids</b><br><br>The ECM has the capability of providing command to the fan relays even while a scan tool output control is being used. Always refer to the fan control command parameters on the scan tool to know which fans are being commanded ON by the ECM. <br><br><b>Reference Information</b><br><br><b>Schematic Reference</b><br><br>Engine Cooling Schematics<br><br><b>Description and Operation</b><br><br>Cooling Fan Description and Operation<br><br><b>Connector End View Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">Cooling System</a> Component Views<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Electrical Center Identification Views<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">Cooling System</a> Connector End Views<br><br><b>Electrical Information Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Circuit Testing<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connector Repairs<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Testing for Intermittent Conditions and Poor Connections<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wiring Repairs<br><br><b>Scan Tool Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Scan Tool Data List<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Scan Tool Data Definitions<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Scan Tool Output Controls<br><br><b>Circuit/System Verification</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that the following DTCs are not set: P0480 or P0481.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If either of the DTCs is set, repair the DTC first.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition ON, command high and low speed fans ON and OFF with a scan tool.
