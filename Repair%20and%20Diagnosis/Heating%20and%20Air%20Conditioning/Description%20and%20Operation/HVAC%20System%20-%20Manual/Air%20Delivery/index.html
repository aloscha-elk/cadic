The battery positive voltage circuit provides power that the control module uses for keep alive memory (KAM). If the battery positive voltage circuit loses power, all HVAC DTCs and settings will be erased from KAM. The body control module (BCM), which is the vehicle mode master, provides a device on signal. The HVAC control module provides blower, air delivery mode, air temperature settings and input signals to auxiliary HVAC control module. The HVAC system assembly receives power from battery input with ignition 3 voltage circuit as a backup.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/465100170.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The HVAC control module supports the features.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Auxiliary HVAC Control Module</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The auxiliary HVAC control module provides blower, air delivery mode and air temperature settings. When the auxiliary position is selected, from the HVAC control module, inputs from this <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Control%2520Assembly/index.html">control assembly</a> will be processed by the Aux. HVAC control module. If equipped with rear seat audio (RSA) the auxiliary HVAC system will support GMLAN.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Front Mode Actuator</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The front mode actuator is a 5 wire bi-directional electric motor that incorporates a feedback potentiometer. Ignition 3 relay voltage, low reference, control, <b>5-Volt</b> reference and position signal circuits enable the actuator to operate. The control circuit uses either, <b>0, 2.5 or 5-Volt</b> signal to command the actuator movement. When the actuator is at rest, the control circuit value is <b>2.5 volts</b>. A <b>0 or 5-Volt</b> control signal commands the actuator movement in opposite directions. When the actuator shaft rotates, the potentiometer adjustable contact changes the door position with a signal ranging between <b>0-5 volts</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The HVAC control module uses a range of 0-255 counts to index the actuator position. The door position signal voltage is converted to a 0-255 count range. When the module sets a commanded, or targeted, value, the control signal is changed to either <b>0 or 5 volts</b> depending upon the direction that the actuator needs to rotate to reach the commanded value. As the actuator shaft rotates the changing position signal is sent to the module. Once the position signal and the commanded value are the same, the module changes the control signal to <b>2.5 volts</b>.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Auxiliary Mode Actuator</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The auxiliary mode actuator is a 5 wire bi-directional electric motor that incorporates a feedback potentiometer.

The front blower control processor regulates supply voltage and ground circuits to front blower motor. The front HVAC control module provides a blower speed signal to the control processor in order to command the desired blower motor speed. The control processor uses the blower motor ground as a low side control to adjust the blower motor speed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Heating%2520and%2520Air%2520Conditioning/Blower%2520Motor/index.html">blower motor</a> forces air to circulate within the vehicle's interior. The vehicle operator determines the blower motors speed by placing the <a>blower motor switch</a> in a desired speed position or by selecting automatic operation.

The modes that may be selected are:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Defrost<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Defog<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Panel<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>BI-Level<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Floor<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The mode actuator is connected to the mode door by a cam type linkage system. Depending on the position of the door, air is directed through the HVAC module and distributed through various ducts leading to the outlets in the dash. If a fault is detected within the mode door travel, the HVAC control module will drive the actuator to defrost, which is a default position for the mode door actuator. Turning the mode door position to either defrost or defog positions, the HVAC control module will move the recirculation actuator to outside air reducing window fogging. When defrost/defog is selected, the A/C compressor is activated. The A/C compressor clutch will engage when ambient temperatures are above <b>3&deg;C (38&deg;F)</b>. A/C is available in all modes. Recirculation is only available in Panel and Bi-Level modes. The rear window defogger does not affect the HVAC system.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Auxiliary Control</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The auxiliary HVAC system provides ventilation for the rear seat occupants. The rear seat occupants will exercise control of the auxiliary air delivery modes, air speed and the air temperature setting. The HVAC control module will have the ability to override the auxiliary HVAC control module by placing it in any position other than auxiliary.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The auxiliary mode switch in the HVAC control module allows the driver to direct the air flow in the rear of the vehicle between the floor, headliner, or a blend between the 2 options. Power is provided to both front and auxiliary HVAC control modules from I/P fuse block on the ignition 3 voltage circuit.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Recirculation Operation</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The HVAC control module controls the air intake through the recirculation actuator. The recirculation switch closes the recirculation door in order to circulate the air within the vehicle. The outside air switch opens the recirculation door in order to route outside air into the vehicle. Regardless of the <a>blower motor switch</a> position, recirculation is available only in the Panel and Bi-Level mode switch positions. The mode switch must be placed in either the Panel or Bi-Level position before the blower motor switch is placed in the OFF position. When Defrost or Defog positions are selected outside air is circulated to the windshield to reduce fogging. If the recirculation switch is pressed into the ON position when the mode switch is in an unavailable mode position, then the recirculation switch LED will flash 3 times.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Remote Start</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Remote Start Activation</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The following describes the HVAC control head functionality upon receiving the remote start active serial data message and a power mode status is set to off/awake.
