The switches are 2 position normally open rocker switches. When placed in either the lock or unlock positions, the switches provide a direct input to the DDS or PDS. The DDS or PDS monitors these inputs and sends a LAN message indicating a change in the switch's respective position. Modules which activate the power door lock motors receive the LAN message and activate the motor in the appropriate direction to lock or unlock the vehicle's doors and liftgate. The rear door lock switch provides a lock and unlock signal to the body control module (BCM).
