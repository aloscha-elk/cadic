<h1>Trunk / Liftgate: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>REAR HATCH/GATE DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION</b><br><br><b>OPERATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>A power open or close cycle can only be initiated from the fully closed or open positions while the vehicle is in park and the liftglass ajar switch input to the liftgate module is inactive. At any time during a power open or close cycle the operation can be reversed by pressing any of the open/close switches. The power liftgate can be switched to manual mode with the on/off switch in the overhead console and during manual operation the power latch will still operate. During power liftgate operation the liftgate module continuously monitors the liftgate position and load profile. The position is calculated from hall effect sensor counts and the electrical load of the gear motor is used to determine physical resistance to the liftgate. Both of these profiles must be learned before the liftgate can operate properly and relearned any time most liftgate components are serviced.<br><br><b>POWER LATCH</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The latch motor is a bi-directional motor and latch or unlatch operation is the result of the direction of the motor rotation. The liftgate module controls the latch motor through the control circuits by suppling power and ground in the appropriate polarity. The motor control circuits are monitored by the liftgate module prior to activation for a high or low condition and during motor operation for an insufficient current flow condition. The ratchet, pawl, and sector switches are part of the latch motor assembly and are used by the liftgate control module to determine the state of the latch during the process of latching or unlatching. Each of the latch switch signal circuits are supplied battery voltage through a resistor and monitored within the liftgate module. The latch switches share a common low reference circuit from the liftgate module and when the switch contacts close the signal circuit goes low and the liftgate module determines the switch to be active.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The handle switch and close switch are parallel circuits and provide a single input to the liftgate control module. The handle/close switch signal circuit is supplied battery voltage through a resistor and monitored within the liftgate module. The switches share a common low reference circuit from the liftgate module and when the switch contacts close the signal circuit goes low and the liftgate module determines the switch to be active.<br><br><b>GEAR MOTOR ASSEMBLY</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The liftgate motor is a bi-directional motor and open or close operation is the result of the direction of the motor rotation. The liftgate module controls the liftgate motor through the control circuits by suppling power and ground in the appropriate polarity. The motor control circuits are monitored by the liftgate module prior to activation for a high or low condition and during motor operation for any irregular current flow conditions.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The liftgate motor clutch engages or disengages the liftgate motor to the liftgate drive gear and is the component that determines power or manual operation. When the liftgate module supplies power to the clutch control circuit the clutch coil is energized and the liftgate motor is engaged to the liftgate drive gear so that power operation can occur. The liftgate module monitors the clutch control circuit at all times for a short high while in an inactive state or a short low or insufficient current flow while in an active state.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The full open switch is part of the gear motor assembly and will close and become active when the liftgate reaches the full open position. The full open switch signal circuit is supplied battery voltage through a resistor and monitored within the liftgate module. The liftgate provides a low reference circuit and when the switch contacts close the signal circuit goes low and the liftgate module determines the switch to be active.<br><br><b>OBJECT DETECTION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The liftgate control module continuously monitors power liftgate operation and calculates its location and direction of travel using 2 hall effect sensors that are part of the gear motor assembly. The hall effect sensors are 3 wire sensors and are supplied with a <b>5 volt</b> power circuit, ground and signal circuits from the liftgate control module. The hall effect sensor signal circuits are referenced from battery voltage within the liftgate control module and pulsed low by the hall effect sensors.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The power liftgate system uses a secondary object detection method which consists of object sensors fixed to both sides of the liftgate near the seal area. The object sensors consist of an internal fixed resistor and normally open switch contacts which when closed will bypass the resistor. The signal circuit is supplied <b>5 volts</b> through a resistor and monitored within the liftgate control module, and during normal power liftgate operation the signal circuit should remain a fixed value. When an object presses one of the sensors the contacts close and the resistor is bypassed causing the signal circuit voltage at the module to go low.</div>
