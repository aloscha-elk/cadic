<h1>Navigation System -  DVD Navigation Update Program</h1><b>INFORMATION</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.:</b> 06-08-44-012F<br><br><b>Date:</b> February 28, 2013<br><br><b>Subject:</b> DVD Navigation Update Program, Navigation Disc Diagnostic Aid, AVN Software Update Discs and Ordering Information<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2002-2013 GM Passenger Cars and Trucks <br><br><b>Attention:</b><br>Please direct this information to your Sales Consultants, Service Consultants, Parts Personnel and Used Car Department. This bulletin ONLY applies to North American dealers/retailers.<br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to include the 2013 model year and update information. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 06-08-44-012E (Section 08 - Body and Accessories).<br><br><b>Navigation System Map Updates</b><br><br>The location information (streets, Points of Interest, etc.) on a vehicle's navigation system ages at a rate of 10%-20% per year. As the map data becomes out of date, the functionality of the navigation system declines. Offering GM customers new map updates will ensure that the customers have the latest information for their system.<br><br>Map updates can be purchased from the GM Navigation Center in two ways:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>GM Navigation Disc Center 1-877-628-3472<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Via the web through gmnavdisc.com<br><br>For information on the most recent map version available for each make/model/year, visit the GM Navigation Center online.<br><br>The Nav Disc Center will always have the latest information on map versions and compatibility. Please contact them if you have any questions on the latest version available for a specific vehicle.<br><br><b>Special Notes on Map Updates</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>General Motors offered a Navigation Disc Update Program for 2006 and 2007 model year vehicles. Customers who purchased vehicles with nav systems were eligible for two free map updates. This program concluded on December 31, 2009. The DVD Navigation Update Program policy has expired. Communications were sent to 2006 MY and 2007 MY vehicle owners when the program ended, informing them that they are no longer eligible for free annual updates.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>There is no longer a reduced price offered for warranty discs. Discs required for warranty repairs must be purchased at the retail price. The maximum allowance for warranty reimbursements has been revised to reflect the change in pricing.<br><br><b>AVN Software Update Discs</b><br><br>Technical Service Bulletins are sometimes generated to address specific navigation radio operational or performance issues. When a navigation radio bulletin is issued, it may contain instructions to install an advanced vehicle navigation (AVN) software update with a specific part number. GM dealers must order advanced vehicle navigation (AVN) software update discs from the Nav Disc Center, as directed in the specific bulletin.<br><br>AVN software update discs are for the dealer to update the navigation radio software only. They do NOT update or replace the navigation map disc that is supplied with the vehicle. Please order these parts only as needed. There is a limited supply of these discs available, so dealers may only order one of a specific part number. Do not order these discs for stock. AVN software update discs can be used to reprogram more than one vehicle. Software update discs are free of charge; dealers are required to pay for shipping.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br></div>
