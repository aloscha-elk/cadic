<h1>Emission - Emissions Programming Warranty Coverage</h1>WARRANTY ADMINISTRATION<br><br>Bulletin No.: 04-06-04-036E<br><br>Date: May 08, 2008<br><br>Subject: <br>Warranty Coverage for Emission-Related Reprogramming Events (PCM, ECM and <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Transmission%2520Control%2520Systems/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520A%252FT/Control%2520Module/index.html">TCM</a>)<br><br>Models:<br>2009 and Prior GM Passenger Cars and Trucks (Including Saturn)<br>2003-2009 HUMMER H2<br>2006-2009 HUMMER H3<br>2009 and Prior Saab Vehicles (Canada Only)<br><br><b>Attention:</b><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>This bulletin applies only to dealers in the United States and Canada. Export dealers are not authorized to utilize this service bulletin.<br><br>Supercede:<br><br>This bulletin is being updated to add an Attention statement. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 04-06-04-036D (Section 06 - Engine).<br><br>The coverage for emission-related reprogramming has the same coverage as the emission controller under the emission controller warranty - 8 years/80,000 miles (130,000 km).<br><br>Reprogramming that is not emissions-related is covered under the terms of the Bumper to Bumper Limited Warranty. (For additional information regarding labor codes for use in non-emission-related reprogramming refer to Corporate Bulletin Number 06-08-47-001D.)<br><br>Emissions-related calibration updates will be announced through a GM Technical Service Bulletin with specific guidelines of coverage for each model affected. A special emission-related reprogramming labor operation will be used. The labor operation to be used for claims relating to emission-related reprogramming is J6353 and will only be referenced in the bulletins addressing emission-related calibrations. This labor operation must NOT be used for non-emissions-related reprogramming or for any other vehicle that is not referenced in an emission-related reprogramming technical service bulletin.<br><br>Example:<br><br>The PCM on 2004 model light duty vehicles is covered by the emission controller warranty for 8 years/80,000 miles (130,000 km). If GM released an "emission-related" calibration update for one of these vehicles, this reprogramming event would also be covered for the remainder of the 8 years/80,000 miles (130,000 km). If GM released a driveability-related calibration update (for example to eliminate a hesitation) for one of these vehicles, this reprogramming event would be covered for the remainder of the terms of the Bumper to Bumper Limited Warranty.<br><br>An emission-related calibration for medium duty and diesel applications are also covered by the emission warranty that is applicable to that vehicle's emissions controller.<br><br>Example:<br><br>The PCM on 2004 model medium duty vehicles is covered by the emission controller warranty for 5 years/50,000 miles (80,000 km). If GM released an "emission-related" calibration update for one of these vehicles, this reprogramming event would also be covered for 5 years/50,000 miles (80,000 km).<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer</div>
