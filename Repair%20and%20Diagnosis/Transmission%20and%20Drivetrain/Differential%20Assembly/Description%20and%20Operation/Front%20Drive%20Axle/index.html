The locking of the two shafts allows the axle to operate in the same manner as a semi-floating rear axle. A propeller shaft connects the transfer case to the front axle. The differential carrier assembly uses a conventional ring and pinion gear set to transmit the driving force of the engine to the wheels. The open differential allows the wheels to turn at different rates of speed while the axle continues to transmit the driving force. This prevents tire scuffing when going around corners and premature wear on internal axle parts. The ring and pinion set and the differential are contained within the carrier. The axle identification number is located on top of the differential carrier assembly or on a label on the bottom of the right half of differential carrier assembly. The drive axles are completely flexible assemblies consisting of inner and outer constant velocity CV joints protected by thermoplastic boots and connected by a wheel drive shaft. <br><br><b>Full-Time Four Wheel Drive (F4WD) Front Axle Description and Operation</b><br><br>The Full-Time Four Wheel Drive (F4WD) Front Axle consist of the following components: <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Transmission%20and%20Drivetrain/Differential%20Assembly/Differential%20Carrier/">Differential Carrier</a> Housing<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Transmission%20and%20Drivetrain/Differential%20Assembly/">Differential Assembly</a><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Output Shaft (Left Side)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inner <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Drive%2520Axles%252C%2520Bearings%2520and%2520Joints/Axle%2520Shaft%2520Assembly/Axle%2520Shaft/index.html">Axle Shaft</a> Housing<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inner Axle Shaft (Right Side)<br><br>The front axle on Full-Time Four Wheel Drive model vehicles does not have a central disconnect feature in order to engage and disengage the front axle.
