<h1>Wiper/Washer System</h1><br><br><b>WIPER/WASHER SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION</b><br><br><b>WINDSHIELD WIPERS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The windshield wiper/washer switch signal circuits are inputs to the body control module (BCM) and the BCM controls <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Motor/index.html">wiper motor</a> low speed operation, washer pump and high speed operation. The windshield wiper/washer switch is provided a low reference from the BCM and each of the switch signal circuits is supplied <b>12 volts</b> through a resistor and monitored within the BCM. During LOW or INTERMITTENT operation the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Switch/index.html">wiper switch</a> low signal circuit is closed to the low reference circuit through a series of resistors within the switch assembly and the signal circuit voltage monitored by the BCM will depend on the switch contact location to the resistor assembly. During HIGH or WASH operation the high and wash switch signal circuits are closed directly to the low reference circuit within the switch assembly and nearly all the signal circuit voltage will be dropped across the BCM resistors. The BCM controls the wiper motor through the <a>Wiper Relay</a> and the Wiper High Relay. During any wiper motor function that uses low speed the BCM supplies the voltage to energize the Wiper Relay and battery voltage will be supplied from the Wiper Relay through the de-energized Wiper High Relay to the wiper motor low speed control circuit. During high speed wiper motor operation the Wiper Relay is energized as in low speed and the BCM provides a ground to energize the Wiper High Relay and the battery voltage is supplied to the wiper motor high speed control circuit. Wiper motor park operation is controlled by the BCM using an input from the park switch within the wiper motor assembly. The BCM supplies the park switch signal circuit <b>12 volts</b> through a resistor then monitors the circuit. Whenever the wiper motor is out of the park position the park switch signal circuit is closed to ground and nearly all the signal circuit voltage will be dropped across the BCM resistor. When the wiper switch is turned to the OFF position while the wiper motor is somewhere in mid-cycle, the BCM will continue to operate the motor until the wipers reach the park position. If the ignition is turned OFF while the wipers are in mid-cycle, the wipers will stop immediately where they are and the BCM will park the wipers the next time the ignition is cycled ON.<br><br><b>MOISTURE SENSITIVE WIPERS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The outside moisture sensor monitors moisture accumulation on the windshield and uses a windshield wiper/washer switch status input to provide wipe commands to the body control module (BCM). The DELAY positions on the wiper/washer switch are used to activate the AUTOMATIC rain sensing operating mode. They are also used to adjust the level of sensitivity to moisture accumulation, which determines the dwell time for commanding a <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Motor/index.html">wiper motor</a> wipe cycle.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Accessory voltage is supplied to the outside moisture sensor from the BCM. The sensor is grounded through the ground circuit and G200. Whenever the ignition is in the run or accessory positions, the BCM sends the wiper/washer switch status using a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal through the outside moisture sensor signal 1 circuit to the outside moisture sensor. When a wipe cycle is needed, the moisture sensor sends a PWM voltage signal through the moisture sensor signal 2 circuit back to the BCM requesting the wiper operation.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The outside moisture sensor uses the moisture sensor signal 2 circuit to command <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Motor/index.html">wiper motor</a> wipe cycles and to confirm the moisture sensor signal 1 is being received. If at anytime communication between the outside moisture sensor and BCM is lost, the BCM will use the inputs from the windshield wiper/washer switch in the delay positions to operate the wiper motor at continuous variable delay intervals.<br><br><b>WINDSHIELD WASHERS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the windshield Wash switch is pressed, ground is applied through the switch contacts and the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Windshield%2520Washer%2520Switch/index.html">windshield washer switch</a> signal circuit to the body control module (BCM) indicating the windshield wash request. The BCM then energizes the WPR relay, as stated above, and the WSH relay by applying ground through the control circuit to the coil side of the relay. With the wash relay energized, battery voltage from the WPR fuse is applied through the switch side of the relay and out to the control circuit of the windshield washer fluid pump. The <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Wiper%2520and%2520Washer%2520Systems/Wiper%2520Motor/index.html">wiper motor</a> will operate for 2 wipe cycles after the wash switch is released.<br><br><b>HEATED WINDSHIELD WASHERS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The windshield washer solvent heater operates with the standard windshield wiper washer system, and when a heated washer cycle is activated the solvent heater controls the windshield washers through the washer switch signal circuit to the body control module (BCM). The heater is supplied with high current power and ground circuits that are used to energize the heater coils. The low current logic voltage is supplied to the heater through the RUN relay in the underhood fuse block. The RUN relay is a PCB relay energized by the BCM only while the engine is running. The heated washer cycle operation is activated by a separate switch located on the instrument panel accessory switch assembly. When the heated washer fluid switch is pressed the heated washer switch signal circuit is momentarily grounded and the heated washer cycle is activated. During the heated wash cycle the 3 heater elements in the solvent heater are energized, and when the solvent temperature reaches approximately <b>70&deg;C (160&deg;F)</b> the heater grounds the washer switch signal circuit until the heated solvent is dispensed. The heated washer cycle will run 4 heat and wash actions unless deactivated by the heated washer switch signal.</div>
