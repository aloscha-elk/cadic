Radial force variation is what the vehicle feels because the load (weight) of the vehicle is always on the <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a>. Although free run-out of tires (not under load) is not always a good indicator of a smooth ride, it is critical that total tire/wheel assembly run-out be within specification.<br><br>GM approved equipment such as the Hunter GSP9700 or Snap-On RFV 2000 loads the tire, similar to on the vehicle, and measures radial force variation of the tire/wheel assembly. Note that the wheel is affecting the tire's RFV measurement at this point. To isolate the wheel, its run-out must be measured. This can be easily done on the Hunter, without the need to set up dial indicators. If the wheel meets the run-out specification, the tire's RFV can then be addressed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Set the tire pressure to the placard values.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Using the Hunter GSP9700 or Snap-On RFV 2000, check the balance of the tire/wheel assembly and make corrections as necessary. <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Measure radial force variation and radial run-out.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make corrections to out of specification RFV and run-out by Tire-to-Wheel Match-Mounting (refer to Document ID: 2084548). <br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Record your measurements before and after on the Balance Summary (Reference Document #3) at the end of this bulletin. It may be of benefit to have the lowest RFV assembly to the front left corner. Re-check on the EVA and if the problem still exists, test another vehicle to find tire(s) that do not exhibit the same frequency and swap those <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> onto the subject vehicle (prior to installation, RFV should be checked on the test vehicle tire assemblies).<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Mark the high point of the tire/wheel assembly to assist with match mounting the assembly to the hub.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important</b><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>After balancing the tire/wheel assemblies, make sure to make a mark on the tire where the valve stem is located. This is to verify that there is no tire slip occurring on the vehicle.</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/123230977.png"></div><br><br><br><br>If match mounting <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> to in-spec <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> produces assembly values higher than these, tire replacement may be necessary. Replacing tires at lower values will probably mean good tires are being condemned. Because tires can sometimes become temporarily flat-spotted, which will affect force variation, it is important that the vehicle be driven at least 26 km (15 mi) prior to measuring. Tire pressure must also be adjusted to the usage pressure on the vehicle's tire placard prior to measuring.<br><br>Most Trucks will tolerate radial force variation up to these levels. However, some trucks are more sensitive, and may require lower levels. Also, there are other tire parameters that equipment such as the Hunter GSP9700 or Snap-On RFV 2000 cannot measure that may be a factor.<br><br><b>Important</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>When mounting a GM wheel to a wheel balancer/force variation machine, always use the wheel's center pilot hole.

Usually a back cone method to the machine should be used. For added accuracy and repeatability, a flange plate should be used to clamp the wheel onto the cone and machine.
