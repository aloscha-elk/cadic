Customers should be instructed to lower the hood slowly to the secondary latch position (hood lowered to first engagement point) then push down firmly on the front edge of the hood to securely close it. You must only push on the rolled top edge of the hood at the very front. Do not push farther back on any flat section of the hood as you may dent the metal. If an attempt is made to "slam" the hood from a wide open point, the resistance of the gas strut may overcome the users input, and result in high closing effort. If the hood is closed properly and excessive pressure is still required to engage the latch, follow this Service Bulletin.<br><br>Supercede:<br><br>This bulletin is being revised to add the 2008 model year.
