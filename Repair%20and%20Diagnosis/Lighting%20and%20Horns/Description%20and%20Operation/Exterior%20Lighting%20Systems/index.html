The BCM controls the relay on the headlamp <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Lighting%2520and%2520Horns/High%2520Beam%2520Relay/index.html">high beam relay</a> control circuit. High beam control is determined by a signal on the headlamp dimmer switch signal circuit from the multifunction switch. When the headlamp dimmer switch signal circuit is grounded, the BCM grounds the headlamp high beam relay control circuit, illuminating the high beam headlamps. The right and left high beam circuits are independent and are fused independently in the underhood fuse block.<br><br><b>LOW BEAMS - STANDARD</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The low beam headlamps receive voltage from the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">headlamp</a> <a>low beam relay</a> located in the underhood fuse block. The BCM controls the relay on the headlamp low beam relay control circuit. Low beam control is determined by a signal on the headlamp dimmer switch signal circuit from the multifunction switch. When the headlamp dimmer switch signal circuit is open, the BCM grounds the headlamp low beam relay control circuit, illuminating the low beam headlamps. The right and left low beam circuits are independent are fused independently in the underhood fuse block.<br><br><b>LOW BEAMS - HIGH INTENSITY DISCHARGE (HID)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Normal operation of the HID system starts at the ballast. The <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">headlamp</a> ballast input connector receives battery positive voltage from fuses in the underhood fuse block. When the low beam headlamps are requested the <a>low beam relay</a> supplies voltage to the ballast on the right headlamp low beam supply voltage circuit and the left headlamp low beam supply voltage circuit, which in turn begins the low beam operation as follows. As soon as the input power is applied, the ballast draws <b>20 amps</b> from the battery for <b>5-10 seconds</b>, depending on the input voltage level. The ballast is then able to charge the 2 outputs leading to the start to <b>-360 volts</b> and ? volts. Negative <b>360 volts</b> and ? volts are the voltages needed by the starter to strike or start the lamp. HID headlamps do not have filaments like traditional bulbs, instead, the starter uses a high voltage transformer to convert the ? volts input power into <b>25,000 volts</b>. The increased voltage is used in order to create an arc between the electrodes in the bulb. The creation of this arc begins the start up process.<br><br><b>LOW VOLTAGE OPERATION OF HID HEADLAMPS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The BCM monitors the vehicle system voltage while in the RUN power mode. When the system voltage drops below <b>8.9 volts</b>, the following will occur:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>STAGE 1: If the low beam headlamps are ON, either manually or automatically, the BCM will turn ON the high beam headlamps by activating the High Beam output.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>STAGE 2: When the system voltage drops below <b>8.5 volts</b>, the following will occur:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the low beam headlamps are currently ON, either manually or automatically, the BCM will turn OFF the low beam headlamps by deactivating the Low Beam output.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the headlamps are then turned ON manually, the manual switch redundancy will cause the low beam headlamps to remain ON.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If during the same ignition cycle, the BCM enters either STAGE 1 or STAGE 2 operations noted above, and then determines that the system voltage has risen, the following will occur:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the BCM has entered STAGE 2 operation, it will not return to STAGE 1 operation until the system voltage rises above <b>9.4 volts</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the BCM has entered STAGE 1 operation, it will not return to normal operation until the system voltage rises above <b>9.8 volts</b>.<br><br><b>ELECTRICAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS WITH HID</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Ensure that the battery and the harness are capable of supplying up to <b>20 amps</b> of current per ballast, with less than <b>2 volts</b> of system loss or voltage drop. Each ballast requires the <b>20 amps</b> in order to ensure normal startup and run up of the lamp. Run up is the term used to describe the extra power level given to the bulb from the <b>-360-volt</b> ballast output. The input current during the steady state operation is <b>3.4 amps</b> at <b>12.8 volts</b>.<br><br><b>RUN UP OF THE HID LAMP</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>After the lamp receives the strike from the starter and the arc is established, the ballast uses its <b>-360-volt</b> output in order to provide the run up power needed in order to keep the lamp ON. The lamp rapidly increases in intensity from a dim glow to a very high-intensity, bright light called a steady state. Within <b>2 seconds</b> of the arc being established in the bulb, <b>70 percent</b> of steady state is complete. <b>100 percent</b> of the steady state is completed within <b>30 seconds</b>. A <b>75-watt</b> power level is necessary in order to bring the lamp to a steady state in the required period of time.<br><br><b>WHEN TO CHANGE THE HID BULB</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Bulb failure occurs when the bulb gets older and becomes unstable. The bulb may begin shutting itself OFF sporadically and unpredictably at first, perhaps only once during a <b>24 hour</b> period. When the bulb begins shutting itself OFF occasionally, the ballast will automatically turn the bulb back ON again within <b>0.5 second</b>. The ballast will re-strike the bulb so quickly that the bulb may not appear to have shut OFF. As the bulb ages, the bulb may begin to shut OFF more frequently, eventually over 30 times per minute. When the bulb begins to shut OFF more frequently, the ballast receives excessive, repetitive current input (<b>20 amps</b>). Repetitive and excessive restarts or re-strikes, without time for the ballast to cool down, will permanently damage the ballast. As a safeguard, when repetitive re-strikes are detected, the ballast will not attempt to re-strike the lamp. The ballast then shuts down and the bulb goes out.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The following symptoms are the noticeable signs of bulb failure:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Flickering light caused in the early stages of bulb failure<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lights go out caused when the ballast detects excessive, repetitive bulb re-strike<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Color change-The lamp may change to a dim pink glow.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Input power to the ballast must be terminated in order to reset the ballasts fault circuitry. In order to terminate the input power to the ballast, turn the lights OFF and back ON again. Turning the lights OFF and back ON again resets all of the fault circuitry within the ballast until the next occurrence of excessive, repetitive bulb re-strikes. When excessive, repetitive bulb re-strikes occur, replace the starter/arc tube assembly. The ballast will begin the start-up process when the starter/arc tube assembly is replaced. Repeatedly resetting the input power can overheat the internal components and cause permanent damage to the ballast. Allow a few minutes of cool-down time in between reset attempts.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Bulb failures are often sporadic at first, and difficult to repeat. Technicians can identify bulb failure by observing if the problem gets progressively worse over the next <b>100 hours</b> of operation.<br><br><b>LIGHT COLOR (W/HID)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>HID headlamps have a different color rating than regular headlamps. The range of white light that is acceptable is broad when compared to halogens. Therefore, some variation in headlight coloring between the right and left <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">headlamp</a> will be normal. One HID at the end of the normal range may appear considerably different in color from one at the other end of the range. A difference in color is normal. Replace the arc tube only if the arc tube is determined to be at the bulb failure stage.<br><br><b>DAYTIME RUNNING LAMPS (DRL)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The DRL will only operate while the engine is running and the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Lighting%2520and%2520Horns/Headlamp%2520Switch/index.html">headlamp switch</a> is in the AUTO position. When these conditions have been met and the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Lighting%2520and%2520Horns/Ambient%2520Light%2520Sensor/index.html">ambient light sensor</a> indicates daytime conditions, the DRL will illuminate. The ambient light sensor is a light sensitive transistor that varies its voltage signal to the BCM in response to changes to the outside ambient light level. When the BCM receives this signal it will either turn ON the dedicated DRL on the X88/Z75, the low beam headlamps only as DRL on the Z88, or the headlamps, park, and <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Tail%20Lamp/">tail lamps</a> for auto <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">headlamp</a> operation in low light conditions. Any function or condition that turns ON the headlights will cancel the DRL operation. The DRL can be manually turned OFF by activating the AHL/DRL switch in the headlamp switch. The AHL/DRL defeat switch sends a ground signal through the DRL switch signal circuit to the BCM. The BCM then turns OFF the DRL. When the AHL/DRL are manually turned OFF at the headlamp switch, the AHL/DRL will default to ON with the next ignition cycle. With the headlight switch in the AUTO position, the DRL will either be turned ON or OFF after an approximate <b>8 second</b> delay, depending on whether daylight or low light conditions are sensed. When the BCM energizes the DRL relay, the DRL receives voltage on the DRL supply voltage circuit.<br><br><b>INTELLIBEAM INTELLIGENT HIGH-BEAM <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Lighting%20and%20Horns/Headlamp/">HEADLAMP</a> CONTROL SYSTEM</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>IntelliBeam is an enhancement to your vehicles headlamp system. Using a digital light sensor on the rearview mirror, the system will turn the vehicles high beam headlamps ON and OFF according to surrounding traffic conditions. The IntelliBeam system will turn ON the high-beam headlamps when it is dark enough, there is no other traffic present, and the IntelliBeam system is enabled. When the conditions are met, the inside rearview mirror will send a serial data message to the BCM requesting high beam headlamp operation.<br><br><b>ACTIVATING AND ENABLING INTELLIBEAM</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Press and release the IntelliBeam button on the inside rearview mirror. The IntelliBeam indicator on the mirror will illuminate to indicate the system has been turned ON. Once the systems has been turned ON, it will remain ON each time the vehicle is started. Additionally, the IntelliBeam system must be enabled. To enable the IntelliBeam system, turn the exterior lamp control to AUTO, with the turn signal/multifunction lever in its neutral position. The high beam ON light will appear on the instrument panel cluster when the high beams are ON.<br><br><b>DRIVING WITH INTELLIBEAM</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>IntelliBeam will only activate the high-beams when driving over <b>32 km/h (20 mph)</b>.
