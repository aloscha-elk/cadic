It is because of these unknown stresses, and the potential to alter reliability, durability and emissions performance, that GM has adopted a policy that prevents any <b>UNAUTHORIZED</b> Service Agent warranty Transaction submissions to any remaining warranty coverage, to the powertrain and driveline components whenever the presence of a non-GM calibration is confirmed - even if the non-GM control module calibration is subsequently removed.<br><br>Warranty coverage is based on the equipment and calibrations that were released on the vehicle at time of sale, or subsequently updated by GM. That's because GM testing and validation matches the calibration to a host of criteria that is essential to assure reliability, durability and emissions performance over the life of the warranty coverage and beyond. Stresses resulting from calibrations that are different from those tested and released by GM can damage and/or weaken components, leading to poor performance and/or shortened life.<br><br>Additionally, non-GM issued <a href="../../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Engine%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">engine control module</a> modifications often do not meet the same emissions performance standards as GM issued calibrations. Depending on state statutes, individuals who install engine control module calibrations that put the vehicle outside the parameters of emissions certification standards may be subject to fines and/or penalties.<br><br>This bulletin outlines the <b>Calibration Retrieval and Calibration Verification Procedures</b> for <b>ALL</b> Service Agents including Service Agents <b>NOT</b> Required to Call PQC for Powertrain/Drivetrain Assembly Replacement Authorization and Service Agents Required to Call PQC for Powertrain/Drivetrain Assembly Replacement Authorization, using the Tech 2(R) or GDS 2 to identify the presence of non-GM control module calibrations. <br><br>If a non-GM calibration is found and verification has taken place through GM, the remaining powertrain and driveline warranty <b>may</b> be blocked and notated in Global Warranty Management (GWM) and the dealership will be notified.
