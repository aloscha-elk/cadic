<h1>Body -  Paint-less Dent Repair Process</h1><b>INFORMATION</b><br><br><b>Bulletin No.:</b> 99-08-51-001C<br><br><b>Date:</b> February 25, 2013<br><br><b>Subject:</b> <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Paint%252C%2520Striping%2520and%2520Decals/Paint/index.html">Paint</a>-less Dent Repair Process<br><br><b>Models:</b><br>2014 and Prior GM Passenger Cars and Light Duty Trucks<br>with Steel Outer Body Panels<br><br>Supercede:<br>This bulletin is being revised to add the 2013 and 2014 model years. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 99-08-51-001B (Section 08 - Body and Accessories).<br><br>The process of removing dents from vehicles without painting has been around for many years. General Motors has evaluated many versions of this process. A process using special tools that allow shallow dents to be removed without drilling holes in the body, by removing components like <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Doors%2C%20Hood%20and%20Trunk/Hood/">hood</a> insulators, tail lamps, and headlamps is recommended. This process is appropriate for the majority of panels with reasonable access to the back side of the damaged area. The special tools and procedures used with <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Paint%252C%2520Striping%2520and%2520Decals/Paint/index.html">paint</a>-less dent repair that have been developed will remove the dents while eliminating the need to fill, paint, or replace the panel.<br><br>New developments in this technology have also made dent removal possible in areas where there is minimal or zero access to the back side of the panel by use of "glue stick" dent removal. From the outside of the panel, adhesive material is placed over the dent, allowed to cool and the dent can be pulled back to its original contour without <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Paint%252C%2520Striping%2520and%2520Decals/Paint/index.html">paint</a> damage. Common areas for "Glue Stick" dent removal are roof rails, pickup box bed rails, roof skin near stationary glass, etc. This process requires no drilling of holes or removal of vehicle components for access. These type of repairs will eliminate concerns about paint and factory corrosion durability and significantly reduce repair and disclosure amounts. This type of procedure has been thoroughly evaluated and the repaired parts were tested for negative impact. No negative impact was found.<br><br><b>Important</b><br><b>The removal of structural components or drilling of holes in any panel is not recommended and may void the General Motors Corrosion Warranty.</b><br><br><b>Evaluating Damage</b><br><br><b>Note</b><br><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Paint%252C%2520Striping%2520and%2520Decals/Paint/index.html">Paint</a>-less dent repair should be used for both warranty "out dent" repair and transportation damage where damage type code "14- dented no paint damage" is used on the delivery receipt. Dents which exceed severity code 3-Damage over 3 inches (8 cm) up to and including 6 inches (15 cm) in length/diameter may still require conventional paint repairs.<br><br>Appropriate uses for <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Paint%252C%2520Striping%2520and%2520Decals/Paint/index.html">paint</a>-less dent repair include the following conditions:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Repair of minor transportation damage dents.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Dents with no broken <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Body%2520and%2520Frame/Paint%252C%2520Striping%2520and%2520Decals/Paint/index.html">paint</a> on the surface.

These will not damage the back side of the dented area. Typically, these tools are shaped and bent in order to allow access to most areas of the vehicle without drilling holes in the body as well as provide a clear view of the work area. Specialty lights are also used to highlight damaged areas.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br></div>
