<h1>Information Bus: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>DATA LINK COMMUNICATIONS DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION</b><br><br><b>CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The communication among control modules is performed through the high speed GMLAN serial data circuits and the low speed GMLAN serial data circuit. The modules that need real time communication are attached to the High Speed GMLAN network. The body control module (BCM) is the gateway between the high and low speed networks. Refer to Body Control System Description and Operation for more information about the gateway.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Signal supervision is the process of determining whether an expected signal is being received or not. Some messages are sent on a periodic basis and are interpreted as a heartbeat of a device. If such a signal is lost, the signal supervision part of the software will set a no communication DTC (U code) against the missing device. This code is mapped on the Tech 2 screen as a code against the physical device. A lost communication DTC typically is set in modules other than the module with a communication failure.<br><br><b>GMLAN HIGH SPEED CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The data link connector (DLC) allows a scan tool to communicate with the high speed GMLAN serial data circuit. The serial data is transmitted on 2 twisted wires that allow speed up to <b>500 kb/s</b>. The twisted pair is terminated with two <b>120-ohm</b> resistors, one is internal to the engine control module (ECM) and the other is after the electronic brake control module (EBCM), or if equipped, the suspension control module. The high speed GMLAN is a differential bus. The high speed GMLAN serial data bus (+) and high speed GMLAN serial data (-) are driven to opposite extremes from a rest or idle level. The idle level, which is approximately <b>2.5 volts</b>, is considered recessive transmitted data and is interpreted as a logic 1. Driving the lines to their extremes, adds <b>1 volt</b> to the high speed GMLAN serial data bus (+) and subtracts <b>1 volt</b> from the high speed GMLAN serial data bus (-) wire. If a communication signal is lost, the application will set a no communication code against the respective control module. This code is mapped on the Tech 2 screen as a code against the physical device.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b>  a loss of serial data DTC does not represent a failure of the module that the code is set in.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The high speed GMLAN serial data allows communication between the body control module (BCM), ECM, transmission control module (TCM), vehicle communication interface module (VCIM), 4WD control module, EBCM, and the suspension control module depending on RPO.<br><br><b>GMLAN LOW SPEED CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The data link connector (DLC) allows a scan tool to communicate with the low speed GMLAN serial data circuit. The serial data is transmitted over a single wire to the appropriate control modules. Under normal vehicle operating conditions, the speed of the buss is <b>33.33 Kb/s</b>. This protocol produces a simple pulse train sent out over the GMLAN low speed serial data bus. When a module pulls the buss high, <b>5 volts</b>, this creates a logic state of 0 on the buss. When the buss is pulled low, <b>0 volts</b>, it is translated as a logic state of 1. To wake the control modules connected to the GMLAN low speed serial data buss, a wake up signal is sent out over the buss. Modules connected to the GMLAN low speed buss can be part of a virtual network as described in GMLAN High Speed Circuit Description above. The modules on the GMLAN low speed serial data buss are connected to the buss using several splice or "star" connectors separating groups of modules. The following lists state the splices and modules connected to the low speed serial data circuits:<br><br><b>I/P SPLICE</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Data link connector (DLC), connected only to the instrument panel (I/P) splice<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Amplifier (Amp)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Rear seat audio (RSA)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vehicle communication interface module (VCIM)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Digital radio receiver (DRR)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inside rearview mirror module (ISRVM), connected through the mid I/P fuse block<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Instrument panel cluster (IPC)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Body control module (BCM)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Theft deterrent module (TDM)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Heater ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Radio<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Driver door switch (DDS), connected through the left I/P fuse block<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Passenger door switch (PDS), connected through the right I/P fuse block<br><br><b>BODY SPLICE</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Articulating running board module (ARBM)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ultrasonic park assist (UPA)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Memory seat module (MSM)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Liftgate module (LGM)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Passenger presence system (PPS)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inflatable restraint vehicle rollover sensor (ROS)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inflatable restraint sensing and diagnostic module (SDM)<br><br><b>DATA LINK CONNECTOR (DLC)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The data link connector (DLC) is a standardized 16-cavity connector.
