<h1>Scheduled Maintenance</h1><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>SCHEDULED <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">MAINTENANCE</a></b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the "CHANGE ENGINE OIL SOON" message in the Driver Information Center (DIC) comes on, it means that service is required for your vehicle. Have your vehicle serviced as soon as possible within the next 600 miles (1 000 km). It is possible that, if you are driving under the best conditions, the engine oil life system may not indicate that vehicle service is necessary for over a year. However, your engine oil and filter must be changed at least once a year and at this time the system must be reset.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If the engine oil life system is ever reset accidentally, you must service your vehicle within 3,000 miles (5 000 km) since your last service. Remember to reset the oil life system whenever the oil is changed. Refer to <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/Service%20Reminder%20Indicators/">Service Reminder Indicators</a> for information on the engine Oil Life System and resetting the system.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the "CHANGE ENGINE OIL SOON" message appears, certain services, checks, and inspections are required. Required services are described in the following for "<a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">Maintenance</a> I" and "Maintenance II." Generally, it is recommended that your first service be Maintenance I, your second service be Maintenance II, and that you alternate Maintenance I and Maintenance II thereafter. However, in some cases, Maintenance II may be required more often.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">MAINTENANCE</a> I</b>  -- Use Maintenance I if the "CHANGE ENGINE OIL SOON" message comes on within 10 months since the vehicle was purchased or Maintenance II was performed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Maintenance/">MAINTENANCE</a> II</b>  -- Use Maintenance II if the previous service performed was Maintenance I. Always use Maintenance II whenever the message comes on 10 months or more since the last service or if the message has not come on at all for one year.</div>
