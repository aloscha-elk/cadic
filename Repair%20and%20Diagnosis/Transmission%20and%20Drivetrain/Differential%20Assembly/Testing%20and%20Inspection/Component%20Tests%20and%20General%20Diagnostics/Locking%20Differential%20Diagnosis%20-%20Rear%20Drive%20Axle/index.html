<h1>Locking Differential Diagnosis - Rear Drive Axle</h1><br><br><b>Locking Differential Diagnosis</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Place the vehicle on a frame-contact hoist, allowing free rotation of the rear wheels.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Hold 1 wheel stationary. Slowly rotate the other wheel approximately 1/2 revolution per second in both the forward and reversed directions. The wheel should rotate freely. The differential is locking and is broken if both wheels attempt to turn together.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Raise the hoist to maximum height with 1 person in the vehicle.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Start the engine. Ensure that the engine is operating at low idle speed (warm engine).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Apply the service brake. Place the automatic transmission in drive. Depress the clutch and place the transmission in first gear with a manual transmission. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lock 1 rear wheel by pulling one parking brake cable from under the vehicle with the aid of an assistant.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Release the service brakes or disengage the clutch slowly enough to start the free wheel turning. The locked rear wheel remains stationary.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Increase the speed of the free wheel. The differential will lock, causing the rotating wheel to stop or both wheels to turn at the same speed. The engine, if equipped with manual transmission, may stall. In order to cause the differential to lock, you may need to accelerate the engine until <b>approximately 16 km/h (10 mph)</b> is indicated on the vehicle speedometer. If the indicated speed can be <b>increased beyond 32 km/h (20 mph)</b> without causing the differential to lock, the unit is not functioning properly. Rapid release of the brakes or clutch, or rapid acceleration of the engine, will invalidate the test.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lock the opposite rear wheel and repeat the procedure.<br><br></div>
