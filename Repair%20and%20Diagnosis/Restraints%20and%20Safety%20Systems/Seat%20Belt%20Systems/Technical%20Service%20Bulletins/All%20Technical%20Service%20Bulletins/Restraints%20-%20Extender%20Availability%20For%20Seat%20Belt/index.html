<h1>Restraints - Extender Availability For Seat Belt</h1>INFORMATION<br><br>Bulletin No.: 99-09-40-005F<br><br>Date: June 23, 2010<br><br>Subject: Seat Belt Extender Availability<br><br>Models:<br>2011 and Prior GM Passenger Cars and Trucks (Including Saturn)<br>2009 and Prior HUMMER H2<br>2010 and Prior HUMMER H3<br>2005-2009 Saab 9-7X<br><br>Supercede:<br><br>This bulletin is being revised to add the 2009&hyphen;2011 model years and update the Warranty Information. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 99-09-40-005E (Section 09  Restraints).<br><br><b>Important:</b><br>DO NOT use belt extenders when securing a <a>child restraint</a>.<br><br>The seat and shoulder belt restraint systems used in all General Motors vehicles have sufficient belt length to accommodate most drivers and passengers. Consequently, requests for belt extensions (extenders) should be minimal.<br><br>Seat belt extenders are available ONLY IN BLACK for most GM passenger cars and trucks produced in recent years. They are available in two different lengths, 23 cm (9 in) and 38 cm (15 in). They are designed to be coupled with the existing belts in each vehicle. When in use, the extender makes the belt arrangement a "custom fit" and use by anyone else or in another vehicle will lessen or nullify the protection offered by the vehicle's restraint system. For this reason, it is extremely important that the correct length extender be used for the vehicle and occupant intended.<br><br><b>Important:</b><br>Do not use an extender just to make it easier to buckle the safety belt. Use an extender only when you cannot buckle the safety belt without using an extender.<br><br>Parts Information<br><br>For part numbers, usage and availability of extenders, see Extension Kit in Group 14.875 (cars) or Group 16.714 (trucks) of the appropriate parts catalog. Saturn retailers should refer to the appropriate model year Parts & Illustration catalog for the vehicle. U.S. Saab dealers should contact the Parts Help line. Canadian Saab dealers should fax requests to Partech Canada.<br><br>Warranty Information<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Seat belt extenders are a NO CHARGE item to all GM customers who request them for their specific vehicles.<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Dealers should not be charging part costs since these extenders are supplied by GM to the dealers.<br><br>^<span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Dealers should not be charging labor costs since the extender can be customer installed.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer</div>
