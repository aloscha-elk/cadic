Some circuits in vehicles are not only susceptible to an intermittent connection, but high resistance may also cause erratic operation or DTCs. An often overlooked possibility in the diagnostics of intermittents is the quality of the terminal crimps.<br><br><b>Note:</b><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>In some circuits where modules compare electrical values to determine proper operation or function, resistance differences as small as "milli-ohms" may cause Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) to set.

Inspect and ensure the integrity of all related wiring harness connectors. If the wiring harness connectors are not properly constructed or engaged before they are locked together, numerous types of intermittent conditions can occur, which may include any of the symptoms listed in the Subject title above and possibly others.<br><br>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Once you have isolated the circuit that connects the components in question, perform a visual and physical inspection of the wiring harness connectors for integrity. Many times, the vehicle may be repaired just by disconnecting and reconnecting the connectors. As with all repairs to wiring harness connectors and terminals, a pull test of the terminals within the connector should be performed. A pull test is performed by inserting the proper size terminal test tool (not a paper clip) into the terminal to determine whether or not the terminal is making good contact, or whether the terminal has been damaged from the prior improper connection or lack of connection.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Notice:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Most terminals used in current module connectors (ECM, <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Relays%2520and%2520Modules/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Relays%2520and%2520Modules%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Body%2520Control%2520Module/index.html">BCM</a>, EBTCM and the like) are small 0.64 mm sq. terminals and can be damaged by probing with the wrong tool. The J 35616-64B probe has been designed for these terminals that may be either a round or square design.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>It is suggested that all prior J-35616-64 test probes prior to version B be discarded.<br><br>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>In many instances once the electrical integrity of a harness is verified, most technicians will question the associated module or component. While this may seem to be a reasonable assumption, it is possible for a harness that tests as electrically conductive to be the source of an intermittent concern.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The suspect electrical harness should have the terminal pins re-crimped before replacing a module or component that test as "OK."<br><br>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The correct crimping tool is required in order to consistently provide secure electrical connections. Please use crimping tool J-3812564 for the Delphi style .64 connectors. The crimping dies are identified with letters numbers or colors on each tool. Always refer to the reference guide to determine which die(s) to use for a given terminal.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Always refer to the reference guide to determine which die(s) to use for a given terminal.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/71390635.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Warranty Information (excluding Saab U.S. Models)<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/71504037.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br>Warranty Information (Saab U.S. Models)<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br><br></div>
