<h1>Vibration Analysis - Engine Balance</h1><br><br><b>Vibration Analysis - Engine Balance</b><br><br><b>Test Description</b><br><br>The numbers below refer to the step numbers on the diagnostic table.<br><b>4.</b>  If sufficient clearance exists to separate the transmission torque converter from the engine flywheel/flexplate, then further tests can be used to isolate the transmission from the engine.<br><b>5.</b>  An engine flywheel/flexplate that has excessive lateral runout, when combined with the mass of the transmission torque converter, can produce a disturbance.<br><b>6.</b>  An engine flywheel/flexplate that is loose at the engine crankshaft or that is cracked or damaged, when combined with the mass of the transmission torque converter, can produce a disturbance.<br><b>7.</b>  This step is designed to isolate the transmission from the engine to determine if the disturbance is related to the engine ONLY.<br><b>9.</b>  Re-indexing the transmission torque converter to the engine flywheel/flexplate alters the balance relationship between the torque converter and the rear of the engine.<br><b>11.</b>  Placing the  J 38792-A sensor onto the underside of the engine oil pan along the FRONT and the REAR edge allows for a determination to be made, which will help to narrow down the cause of the disturbance.<br><b>13.</b>  An engine flywheel that has excessive lateral runout, when combined with the extra mass of the clutch pressure plate and clutch driven plate, can produce a disturbance.<br><b>14.</b>  The clutch pressure plate and the engine flywheel are marked for proper indexing of the heavy-spot of one to the light-spot of the other. Improper indexing of the pressure plate to the flywheel can produce a disturbance.<br><b>15.</b>  An engine flywheel that is loose at the engine crankshaft or that is cracked, damaged and/or missing balance weights; and/or a clutch pressure plate and clutch driven plate that has loose springs, cracks, warpage, damage and/or missing balance weights - can produce a disturbance when their mass is combined.<br><b>16.</b>  An engine flywheel that is loose at the engine crankshaft or that is cracked, damaged and/or missing balance weights; and/or a clutch pressure plate and clutch driven plate that has loose springs, cracks, warpage, damage and/or missing balance weights - can produce a disturbance when their mass is combined.<br><b>17.</b>  Re-indexing the pressure plate to the engine flywheel alters the balance relationship between the pressure plate/flywheel assembly and the rear of the engine.<br><b>18.</b>  An engine flywheel/flexplate that is damaged, misaligned, and/or imbalanced, can produce a disturbance.<br><b>19.</b>  An engine crankshaft balancer that is damaged, misaligned, and/or imbalanced, can produce a disturbance.<br><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/580112782.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/580130232.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/580149062.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/580167002.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/580184821.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/580210599.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/580236694.png"></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div>
