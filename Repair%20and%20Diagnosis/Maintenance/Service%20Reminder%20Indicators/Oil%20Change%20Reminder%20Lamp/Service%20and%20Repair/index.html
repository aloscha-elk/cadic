<h1>Oil Change Reminder Lamp: Service and Repair</h1><br><br><b>Engine Oil Life System</b><br><br><b>When to Change Engine Oil</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>This vehicle has a computer system that indicates when to change the engine oil and filter. This is based on engine revolutions and engine temperature, and not on mileage. Based on driving conditions, the mileage at which an oil change is indicated can vary considerably. For the oil life system to work properly, the system must be reset every time the oil is changed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the system has calculated that oil life has been diminished, it indicates that an oil change is necessary. A CHANGE ENGINE OIL SOON message comes on. See DIC Warnings and Messages. Change the oil as soon as possible within the next 600 miles (1 000 km). It is possible that, if driving under the best conditions, the oil life system might not indicate that an oil change is necessary for over a year. However, the engine oil and filter must be changed at least once a year and at this time the system must be reset. Your dealer/retailer has trained service people who will perform this work using genuine parts and reset the system. It is also important to check the oil regularly and keep it at the proper level.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If the system is ever reset accidentally, the oil must be changed at 3,000 miles (5 000 km) since the last oil change. Remember to reset the oil life system whenever the oil is changed.<br><br><b>How to Reset the Engine Oil Life System (From Owner's Manual)</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The Engine Oil Life System calculates when to change the engine oil and filter based on vehicle use. Whenever the oil is changed, reset the system so it can calculate when the next oil change is required. If a situation occurs where the oil is changed prior to a CHANGE ENGINE OIL SOON message coming on, reset the system.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Always reset the engine oil life to 100% after every oil change. It will not reset itself. To reset the Engine Oil Life System:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Display the OIL LIFE REMAINING on the DIC. If the vehicle does not have DIC buttons, the vehicle must be in P (Park) to access this display.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Press and hold the SET/RESET button on the DIC, or the trip odometer reset stem if the vehicle does not have DIC buttons, for more than five seconds. The oil life will change to 100%.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If the CHANGE ENGINE OIL SOON message comes back on when the vehicle is started, the Engine Oil Life System has not reset. Repeat the procedure.<br><br><b>GM Oil Life System Resetting (From Service Manual)</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the system has calculated that oil life has been diminished, it will indicate that an oil change is necessary.

Do not let used oil stay on your skin for very long. Clean your skin and nails with soap and water, or a good hand cleaner. Wash or properly dispose of clothing or rags containing used engine oil. See the manufacturer's warnings about the use and disposal of oil products.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Used oil can be a threat to the environment. If you change your own oil, be sure to drain all the oil from the filter before disposal. Never dispose of oil by putting it in the trash, pouring it on the ground, into sewers, or into streams or bodies of water. Recycle it by taking it to a place that collects used oil.</div>
