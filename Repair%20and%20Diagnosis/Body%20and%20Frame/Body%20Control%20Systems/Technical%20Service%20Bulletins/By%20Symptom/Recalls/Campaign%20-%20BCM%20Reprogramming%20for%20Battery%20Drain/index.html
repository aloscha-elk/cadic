IT IS RECOMMENDED TO COMPLETE THE BULLETIN PROCEDURE ON CUSTOMER VEHICLES FIRST. VEHICLES IN INVENTORY SHOULD BE PROGRAMMED DURING OFF PEAK HOURS IF SLOW PERFORMANCE IS EXPERIENCED.<br><br>Purpose<br><br>This bulletin provides a service procedure to reprogram the body control module (BCM). On these vehicles, and under certain conditions such as operating the radio with the engine off the battery can become discharged, preventing engine start-up.<br><br>This service procedure should be completed as soon as possible on involved vehicles currently in dealer/retailer inventory and customer vehicles that return to the dealer/retailer for any type of service during the New Vehicle Limited Warranty coverage period.<br><br>Vehicles Involved<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/67526615.png"></div><br><br><br><br>A list of involved vehicles currently in dealer inventory is attached to the Administrative Message (US) or Dealer Communication (Canada) used to release this bulletin. Customer vehicles that return for service, for any reason, and are still covered under the vehicle's base warranty, and are within the VIN breakpoints provided below, should be checked for vehicle eligibility in the appropriate system listed below.<br><br><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Dealers are to confirm vehicle eligibility prior to beginning repairs by using GMVIS.

Technicians may notice the slower application performance from mid-morning until late afternoon.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>To assist in improving performance and reduce programming time, it is recommended to complete the bulletin procedure on customer vehicles first. Vehicles in inventory should be programmed during off peak hours if slow performance is experienced.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The calibration numbers required for this service procedure are programmed into control modules via a Techline Tech 2(R) scan tool and the Techline Information System (TIS) terminal with the calibration update. Use TIS 2 Web version 2.0 for 2007 (available on 02/04/07) and on TIS DVD version 2.0/2007 or later, that was mailed to dealers on 02/14/2007. If you cannot access the calibration, call the Techline Customer Support Center.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Notice:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Before reprogramming, please check the battery condition to prevent a reprogramming error of any of the modules due to battery discharge. Battery voltage must be between 12 and 16 volts during reprogramming. If the vehicle battery is not fully charged, use jumper cables from an additional battery. Be sure to turn off or disable any system that may put a load on the battery, such as automatic headlamps, daytime running lights, interior lights, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, radio, engine cooling fan, etc. A programming failure or control module damage may occur if battery voltage guidelines are not observed.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition switch must be in the proper position. The Tech 2(R) prompts you to turn ON the ignition, with the engine OFF. DO NOT change the position of the ignition switch during the programming procedure, unless instructed to do so.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make certain all tools connections are secure, including the following components and circuits:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The RS-232 communication cable port<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The connection at the data link connector (DLC)<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The voltage supply circuits<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DO NOT disturb the tool harnesses while programming.
