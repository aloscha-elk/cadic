The system is powered by a battery supply circuit and ignition and retained accessory power signal circuits determine when the may be operated. The switch signal circuits are supplied battery voltage through a resistor and monitored within the ECU. When a sunroof switch is pressed the switch signal circuit is closed to ground and most of the voltage supplied to the signal circuit will be dropped across the resistor within the ECU indicating the switch is active<br><br><b>CIRCUIT/SYSTEM VERIFICATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Verify that the Retained Accessory Power (RAP) circuit is
