Refer to Rear Drive Axle Description and Operation.<br><br><b>Rear Axle Noise</b><br><br>The proper diagnosis is an important part of rear axle repair. In axle work, one of the most difficult conditions to diagnose is noise. Locating a broken <a href="../../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Drive%2520Axles%252C%2520Bearings%2520and%2520Joints/Axle%2520Shaft%2520Assembly/Axle%2520Shaft/index.html">axle shaft</a> or broken differential gear presents little or no problems, but locating and isolating axle noise can be an entirely different matter.<br><br>Any gear driven unit, especially an automotive drive axle where the engine torque multiplication occurs at a <b>90 degree</b> turn in the driveline, produces a certain amount of noise. Therefore, an interpretation must be made for each vehicle in order to determine where the noise is normal or if a problem actually exists. A certain amount of noise must be expected and cannot be eliminated by conventional repairs or adjustment.<br><br>Normal axle noise can be described as a slight noise heard only at a certain speed or under unusual or remote conditions. For example, the noise tends to reach a peak at speeds from <b>60-100 km/h (40-60 mph)</b> depending on road and load conditions, or on gear ratio and tire size. This slight noise is in no way indicative of trouble in the axle assembly.<br><br>Driveline noises may confuse even the best technician.
