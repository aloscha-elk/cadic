<h1>Tire Monitor System - Pressure Sensor Relearn Procedure</h1>Bulletin No.: 06-03-16-002A<br><br>Date: March 14, 2007<br><br>INFORMATION<br><br>Subject:<br>Information to Relearn TPM Sensors When the Drivers Information Center (DIC) Displays Dashes For All Tire Pressure Readings<br><br>Models:<br>2007 Buick Lucerne<br>2007 Cadillac Escalade, Escalade ESV, Escalade EXT<br>2006 Chevrolet Impala, Monte Carlo<br>2007 Chevrolet Avalanche, Silverado, Suburban, Tahoe<br>2007 GMC Sierra, Yukon, Yukon Denali, Yukon XL, Yukon Denali XL<br><br>Supercede:<br><br>This bulletin is being revised to remove the PI reference. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 06-03-16-002 (Section 03 - Suspension).<br><br>If the Drivers Information Center (DIC) displays all four tire pressure readings as dashes, please note the following information.<br><br>If the vehicle battery is disconnected, the TPM Sensor IDs are retained BUT the tire pressures are lost. This is because the receiver cannot assume that tire pressure is maintained over an unknown period of time. The DIC will display "dashes" and the Tech 2 will indicate the default value (148PSI). This is normal operation.<br><br>The following situations may cause the values on the DIC to show as dashes:<br><br>A blown or removed fuse for the Remote Control Door Lock Receiver (RCDLR).<br><br>A battery disconnect for any service procedure.<br><br>Any procedure that causes the vehicle system voltage to go very low (Dead Battery, SPS Programming with a low battery, etc.).<br><br>Delivery of a new vehicle off of the car carrier.<br><br>In order to restore the tire pressure values in the Drivers Information Center:<br><br>Operate the vehicle by driving for 5 minutes. This will cause the TPM sensors to transmit and the pressure displays will return to normal.<br><br>The values may also be restored by using the J 46079 TPM tool and using the "activate" function at each tire to activate each sensor (it is not necessary to put the TPM system in learn mode). This will cause them to transmit the tire pressure and the displays will return to normal.<br><br>The pressure release method will also cause each sensor to transmit the current tire pressure.<br><br>The following procedures "clear" the memory of the Remote Control Door Lock Receiver (RCDLR) and require the key fobs to be re-learned. The TPM System needs the tire type and placard information re-learned along with the TPM Sensor IDs. Refer to SI for the procedures.<br><br>SPS programming through TIS-Web of the Remote Control Door Lock Receiver (RCDLR) Replacement of the Remote Control Door Lock Receiver (RCDLR).<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br></div>
