<h1>A/T - Torque Converter Replacement Information</h1>INFORMATION<br><br>Bulletin No.: 01-07-30-010C<br><br>Date: May 12, 2008<br><br>Subject: <br><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Transmission%20and%20Drivetrain/Automatic%20Transmission%2FTransaxle/">Automatic Transmission/Transaxle</a> Torque Converter Replacement<br><br>Models:<br>2009 and Prior GM Passenger Cars and Trucks<br>2009 and Prior HUMMER H2, H3<br>2009 and Prior Saturn Cars and Light Duty Trucks (Except VTi Equipped Vehicles (RPO M16 and M75)<br>2009 and Prior Saab 9-7X<br><br>with ALL Automatic Transmissions and Transaxles<br><br>Supercede:<br><br>This bulletin is being revised to add the 2007-2009 model years. Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 01-07-30-010B (Section 07 - Transmission/Transaxle).<br><br>The purpose of this bulletin is to help technicians determine when a torque converter should be replaced. Below is a list of general guidelines to follow.<br><br>The converter should NOT be replaced if the following apply:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>DTC P0742 - TCC stuck on is set. This code is almost always the result of a controls condition (i.e. stuck TCC solenoid/valve). Experience has shown that this code rarely indicates a mechanical concern within the torque converter.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The fluid has an odor or is discolored but no evidence of metal contamination.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Fine metal particles (traces of metal flakes/gray color to fluid ) are found in the converter. This is not harmful to the torque converter.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The vehicle has been exposed to high mileage.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>A small amount of wear appears on the hub where the oil pump drive gear mates to the converter (RWD only). A certain amount of such wear is normal for both the hub and oil pump gear. Neither the converter nor the front pump assembly should be replaced.<br><br>The torque converter should be replaced under any of the following conditions:<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The vehicle has TCC shudder and/or no TCC apply. First complete all electrical and hydraulic diagnosis and check for proper engine operation. The converter clutch may be damaged. Also the converter bushing and/or internal 0-ring may be damaged.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Evidence of damage to the oil pump assembly pump shaft turbine shaft drive sprocket support and bearing or metal chips/debris in the converter.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Metal chips/debris are found in the converter or when flushing the cooler and the cooler lines.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>External leaks in the hub weld area lug weld or closure weld.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Converter pilot is broken damaged or fits poorly into the crankshaft.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The converter hub is scored or damaged.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The transmission oil is contaminated with engine coolant engine oil or water.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If excessive end play is found after measuring the converter for proper end play (refer to Service Manual).<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If metal chips/debris are found in the fluid filter or on the magnet and no internal parts in the unit are worn or damaged. This indicates that the material came from the converter.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>The converter has an unbalanced condition that results in a vibration that cannot be corrected by following Converter Vibration Procedures.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Blue converter or dark circular ring between lugs. This condition will also require a complete cleaning of the cooler and a check for adequate flow through the cooler.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Converter bearing noise determined by noise from the bell housing area in Drive or Reverse at idle. The noise is gone in Neutral and Park.<br><br>^<span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>If silicon from the viscous clutch is found in the lower pan (4T80-E ONLY).<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/55650223.png"></div><br><br><br><br>Disclaimer<br></div>
