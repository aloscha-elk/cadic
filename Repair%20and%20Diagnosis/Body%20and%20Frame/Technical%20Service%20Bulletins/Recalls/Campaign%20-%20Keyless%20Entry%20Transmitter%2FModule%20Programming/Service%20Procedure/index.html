Vehicles are sold with two transmitters. However, customers have the option to purchase additional transmitters. Ensure that customers understand that all of the transmitters that are to be recognized by the remote control door lock receiver (RCDLR) must be programmed at one time in order to function properly. Program the transmitters that the customer provides to you using a scan tool. Inform the customer that all of the remaining transmitters will not function properly until they are programmed. Customers must program all of their transmitters, including the transmitters programmed at your dealership, at one time, using the driver information center (DIC) programming method. Inform customers to locate and program their transmitters using the procedure provided. This procedure is also published in the owner manual.<br></div>
