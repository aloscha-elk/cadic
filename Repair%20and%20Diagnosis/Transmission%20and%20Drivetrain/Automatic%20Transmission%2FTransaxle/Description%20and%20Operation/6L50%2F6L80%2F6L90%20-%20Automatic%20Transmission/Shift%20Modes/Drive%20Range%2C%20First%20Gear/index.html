<h1>Drive Range, First Gear</h1><br><br><b>Drive Range, First Gear</b><br><br>As the vehicle speed increases, the transmission control module (TCM) receives input signals from the automatic transmission input and output speed sensors, throttle position sensor and other vehicle sensors to determine the precise moment to deenergize or "turn off" shift solenoid 1 and command OFF the normally-high CBR1/C456 pressure control solenoid 3.<br><br><b>Low & Reverse Clutch Releases</b><br><br><b>Shift Solenoid 1</b><br><br>When shift solenoid 1 is "turned OFF", CSV2 enable fluid from the clutch select valve 2 passes by the #2 ball check valve and enters the solenoid 1 fluid circuit. Solenoid 1 fluid from the #2 ball check valve and TCC regulator valve is then routed to the solenoid where it exhausts.<br><br><b>Clutch Select Valve 2</b><br><br>Clutch select valve 2 (CSV2) enable fluid is exhausted from the clutch select valve 2 and clutch select valve 2 spring force moves the valve to the released position. With clutch select valve 2 in the released position, drive fluid from the manual valve passes through the valve and enters the drive 1-6 fluid circuit. Drive 1-6 fluid then feeds all clutch regulator valves and the TCC regulator valve.<br><br><b>CBR1/C456 Pressure Control Solenoid 3</b><br><br>The CBR1/C456 pressure control solenoid 3 is commanded OFF allowing PCS CBR1/C456 fluid from the CBR1/C456 clutch regulator valve and 456 clutch boost valve to exhaust.<br><br><b>CBR1/C456 Clutch Regulator Valve</b><br><br>CBR1/C456 clutch regulator valve spring force moves the valve to exhaust the CBR1/456 clutch feed circuit and allow drive 1-6 fluid to enter the PS5 fluid circuit. PS5 fluid is then routed to the normally-closed pressure switch 5 and opens the switch. PS5 fluid is also routed to the #4 ball check valve and flows into the CSV2 latch fluid circuit.<br><br><b>#4 Ball Check Valve</b><br><br>PS5 fluid pressure seats the #4 ball check valve against the 456 <a>clutch fluid</a> circuit. PS5 fluid is then directed into the CSV2 latch fluid circuit and routed to the clutch select valve 2. CSV2 latch fluid combines with clutch select valve 2 spring force and holds the valve in this position during all 6 forward gear ranges.<br><br><b>#5 Ball Check Valve</b><br><br>Drive 1-6 fluid pressure seats the #5 ball check valve against the 35 clutch reverse feed fluid passage. Drive 1-6 fluid is then directed into the 35R supply fluid circuit which is routed to the #7 ball check valve and orifice #25.<br><br><b>#7 Ball Check Valve</b><br><br>The 35R supply fluid seats the #7 ball check valve against the 35R feed fluid passage to force 35R supply fluid through orifice #25 before entering the 35R feed circuit. The 35R feed fluid is then routed to the 3-5 reverse clutch regulator valve.<br><br><b>Low and Reverse Clutch</b><br><br>Low and reverse clutch spring force moves the low and reverse clutch piston which forces clutch braking (CBR) and CBR1 fluid out of the <a>center support</a>. CBR fluid is routed to the clutch select valve 3 where it exhausts. CBR1 fluid is routed to the clutch select valve 2 where it exhausts. The low and reverse clutch is in the released position.<br><br><b>Drive Range, First Gear</b><br><br><h3>Drive Range, First Gear:</h3><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/335379236.jpeg"></div><br><br><br><br></div>
