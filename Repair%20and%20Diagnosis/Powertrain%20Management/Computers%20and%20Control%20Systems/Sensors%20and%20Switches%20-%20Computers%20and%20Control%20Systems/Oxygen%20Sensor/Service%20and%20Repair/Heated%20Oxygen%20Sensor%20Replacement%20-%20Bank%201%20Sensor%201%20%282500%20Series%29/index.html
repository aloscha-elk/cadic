Removal of the ground wire will cause poor engine performance.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ensure that the peripheral seal remains intact on the vehicle harness connector in order to prevent damage due to water intrusion. The engine harness may be repaired using Packard's Crimp and Splice Seals Terminal Repair Kit.

The compound consists of liquid graphite and glass beads. The graphite tends to burn away, but the glass beads remain, making the sensor easier to remove. New, or service replacement sensors already have the compound applied to the threads. If the sensor is removed from an exhaust component and if for any reason the sensor is to be reinstalled, the threads must have anti-seize compound applied before the reinstallation.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/92637366.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If reinstalling the old sensor, coat the threads with anti-seize compound GM P/N 12377953, or equivalent.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>NOTE:</b>  Refer to Component Fastener Tightening Notice.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Install the HO2S (1).<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tighten the sensor to <b>42 N.m (31 lb ft)</b>.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/92623760.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connect the HO2S electrical connector to the engine wiring harness electrical connector (3).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Install the CPA retainer (2).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Install the front propeller shaft to the front differential, if equipped with 4WD.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Lower the vehicle.</div>
