<h1>Audio System Troubleshooting Hints</h1><br><br><b>AUDIO SYSTEM TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS</b><br><br>Many conditions that affect radio operation may be corrected without removing the radio from the car. Verify the condition, and follow the diagnostic procedures in order to isolate and correct the condition. In order to properly diagnose any audio system problems, ensure that you have a fully charged battery.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Preliminary Inspections</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  When testing the audio system for poor reception or noise, the vehicle should be outside away from metal buildings and utility lines, with the hood and rear compartment closed.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Check for any aftermarket equipment that may have been installed on the vehicle. If aftermarket equipment is found disconnect it and check if the audio noise is still present.Inspect that the antenna connector and the antenna coaxial cable are clean and tight.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For reception concerns, first determine if the customer is within the listening area of the stations they are attempting to receive.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Stations at the lower end of the FM band are more susceptible to audio noises than stations at the higher end.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If the noise is only from one speaker check for the following before speaker replacement:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Isolate the noise using the J 39916-A CD and Cassette Diagnostic Audio Kit.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Inspect the speaker connections to ensure they are clean and tight.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Inspect for a loose or incorrectly installed speaker or surrounding trim.
