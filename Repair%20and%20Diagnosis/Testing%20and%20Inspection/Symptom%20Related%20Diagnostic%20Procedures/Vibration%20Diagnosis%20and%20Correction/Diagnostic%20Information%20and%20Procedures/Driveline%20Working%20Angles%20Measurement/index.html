Propeller shaft systems that have 1 U-joint have 1 working angle; systems with 2 U-joints have 2 working angles, and so on. In a typical 1-piece prop system with 2 U-joints, the working angles are front (1) and rear (2):<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The front working angle (1) is formed by the intersection of the transmission or transfer case output shaft and the prop shaft.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The rear working angle (2) is formed by the intersection of the prop shaft and the drive axle pinion.<br><br><br><b>Important:</b>  <b>When measuring and evaluating U-joint working angles, observe the following:</b><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>No U-joint working angle should be equal to zero. An angle of 0 degrees will cause premature U-joint wear due to a lack of rotation of the needle bearings in the U-joint.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>No U-joint working angle should exceed 4 degrees.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Prop systems containing only 1 U-joint: The U-joint working angle should be within the range specified in this procedure.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Prop systems containing 2 or 3 U-joints: The 2 U-joint angles each formed with the prop shaft that contains 2 welded yokes are designed to cancel each other during operation. These 2 working, or cancelling U-joint angles should be equal to each other within the range specified in this procedure provide effective cancellation of the U-joints.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>*<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Prop systems containing 3 U-joints: The U-joint angle formed by the prop shaft that contains only 1 welded yoke is an odd, or non-cancelled angle.

The weight of 3.8 L (1 gal) of gasoline is approximately 2.8 kg (6.2 lb).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Raise and support the vehicle. On vehicles with solid axles, ensure that the drive axle is supported at ride height-vehicle body supported by suspension components. Suspension travel will not affect driveline angles on vehicles with direct-mounted drive axles. Ensure the wheels are free to rotate. Refer to  Lifting and Jacking the Vehicle .<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For vehicles with 2-piece prop shaft systems, inspect the lateral alignment of the propeller shafts before proceeding:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>From underneath the propeller shafts, look down the length of the shafts from front to rear. Inspect the alignment of the shafts to each other.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>From underneath the shafts, if the propeller shafts are not aligned to each other in a straight line, then the lateral alignment of the prop shafts needs to be adjusted before proceeding.<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The propeller shaft support bearing assembly can be relocated slightly to one side in order to improve the alignment of the shafts. Ensure that you do not create a ground-out condition against the exhaust or any other component.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Place the transmission in NEUTRAL.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Clean any corrosion or foreign material from the U-joint bearing caps.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove any of the U-joint bearing cap snap rings that may interfere with the correct placement of the  J 23498-A  , or equivalent .<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/580861955.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For all prop systems perform the first measurement:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Rotate the prop shaft to align the rear-most yoke flanges vertically.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Install the  J 23498-A  , or equivalent to the lower U-joint bearing cap of the rear-most yoke. This yoke may be part of a prop shaft, torque tube input shaft, or a drive axle pinion shaft. Measure and record the angle of the shaft.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For prop systems with 2 or 3 U-joints, perform this additional measurement:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Without rotating the prop, install the  J 23498-A  , or equivalent to the lower U-joint bearing cap of the forward-most, vertically-aligned yoke. This yoke may be part of a prop shaft, transmission output shaft, or a transfer case output shaft. Measure and record the angle of the shaft.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For all prop systems perform the second measurement:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Rotate the prop shaft 1/4 turn to vertically align the flanges of the forward yoke that mates to the rear-most yoke.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Install the  J 23498-A  , or equivalent to the lower U-joint bearing cap of the forward mating yoke. This yoke may be part of a prop shaft, transmission output shaft, or a transfer case output shaft. Measure and record the angle of the shaft.<br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>10.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For prop systems with 3 U-joints, perform this additional measurement:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Without rotating the prop, install the  J 23498-A  , or equivalent to the lower U-joint bearing cap of the forward-most, vertically-aligned yoke. This yoke may be part of a transmission output shaft, or a transfer case output shaft. Measure and record the angle of the shaft.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>11.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the  J 23498-A  , or equivalent .<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>12.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Install any U-joint bearing cap snap rings that were removed prior to installing the  J 23498-A  , or equivalent .<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>13.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Calculate the U-joint working angle at each intersection of two shafts.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Subtract the larger number from the smaller to obtain the working angle. For example: If the drive axle pinion has an angle of 16 degrees and the connecting propeller shaft has an angle of 13 degrees, then the working angle of that intersection is 3 degrees.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>14.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For prop systems with 1 U-joint; compare the working angle to the following specification guideline:<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>Prop systems containing only 1 U-joint: The U-joint working angle should be between 1/2 and 3/4 degrees.</b><br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>15.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For prop systems with 2 or 3 U-joints; compare the difference between the working angles of the cancelling U-joints to the following specification guidelines:<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>Allowable range of difference between cancelling U-joint working angles: 0.25 to 1.0 degrees</b><br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>16.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>For prop systems with 3 U-joints; compare the working angle of the odd, or non-cancelled U-joint to the following specification guideline:<br><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span><b>Prop systems containing 3 U-joints: The odd, or non-cancelled U-joint working angle should be between 1/10 and 1/2 degrees.</b><br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>17.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Any working angle that is not within the specification guidelines requires adjustment.<br><br><br></div>
