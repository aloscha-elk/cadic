<h1>Restraint System Diagnosis</h1><br><br><b>DTC B1019</b><br><br><b>DTC Descriptors</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>DTC B1019 00</b>: System Configuration Error.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>DTC B1019 3A</b>: Incorrect Component Installed.<br><br><b>Circuit/System Description</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The passenger air bag ON/OFF indicators are used to notify the driver when the Passenger Presence System (PPS) has enabled or disabled the I/P inflator module. When the ignition is turned ON, the ignition voltage is supplied to the passenger air bag ON/OFF indicators and to the PPS module. The instrument panel cluster (IPC) grounds all indicator control circuits to the passenger air bag ON/OFF indicators for illumination. The IPC receives serial data messages from the supplemental inflatable restraints system to turn ON the indicators as necessary.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>After the sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) is programmed, the SDM setup procedure is required. During this set up procedure, the SDM will compare the content that was just programmed to the actual components that are installed on the vehicle. If the SDM detects that there are too few or too many components on the system, DTC B1019 00 will set and not allow the setup procedure to complete.<br><br><b>Conditions for Running the DTC</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>B1019 3A</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition voltage is between 9-16 volts.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>B1019 00</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition voltage is between 9-16 volts.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Setup SDM procedure has been initiated.<br><br><b>Conditions for Setting the DTC</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>B1019 00</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The SDM was programmed with the wrong options for the vehicle.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The wrong components were installed for the content of the vehicle.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>SDM Connector may have bent pins or shorting bars causing the SDM to learn deployment loops that are not actually present.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>There is a wiring, sensor or deployment loop fault which prevents the SDM from learning a device that is present.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>There are too few components installed then configured.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>There are too many components installed then configured.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>B1019 3A</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle was configured for PPS but the SDM has received message from the IPC indicating that the Passenger Air bag Status Indicator is not present/connected.
