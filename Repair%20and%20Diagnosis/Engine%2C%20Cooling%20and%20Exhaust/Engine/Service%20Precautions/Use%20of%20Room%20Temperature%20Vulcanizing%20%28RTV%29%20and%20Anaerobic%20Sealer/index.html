<h1>Use of Room Temperature Vulcanizing (RTV) and Anaerobic Sealer</h1><br><br><b>Use of Room Temperature Vulcanizing (RTV) and Anaerobic Sealer</b><br><br><b>Pipe Joint Compound</b><br><br><b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3 types of sealer are commonly used in engines. These are room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) sealer, anaerobic gasket eliminator sealer, and pipe joint compound. The correct sealer and amount must be used in the proper location to prevent oil leaks. DO NOT interchange the 3 types of sealers. Use only the specific sealer or the equivalent as recommended in the service procedure.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Pipe joint compound is a pliable sealer that does not completely harden. This type of sealer is used where 2 non-rigid parts, such as the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Engine%252C%2520Cooling%2520and%2520Exhaust/Engine/Engine%2520Lubrication/Oil%2520Pan/index.html">oil pan</a> and the engine block, are assembled together.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Do not use pipe joint compound in areas where extreme temperatures are expected.

This type of sealer is used where 2 rigid parts, such as castings, are assembled together.
