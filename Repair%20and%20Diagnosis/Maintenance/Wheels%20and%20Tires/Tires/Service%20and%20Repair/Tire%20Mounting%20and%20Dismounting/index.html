<h1>Tire Mounting and Dismounting</h1><br><br><b>Tire Mounting and Dismounting</b><br><br><b>Notice:</b> Use a tire changing machine in order to dismount <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a>. Do not use hand tools or tire irons alone in order to remove the tire from the wheel. Damage to the tire beads or the wheel rim could result.<br><br><b>Notice:</b> Do not scratch or damage the clear coating on aluminum <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> with the tire changing equipment. Scratching the clear coating could cause the aluminum wheel to corrode and the clear coating to peel from the wheel.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Notice:</b> Damage to either the tire bead or the wheel mounting holes can result from the use of improper wheel attachment or tire mounting procedures. It takes up to <b>70 seconds</b> for all of the air to completely exhaust from a large tire. Failure to follow the proper procedures could cause the tire changer to put enough force on the tire to bend the wheel at the mounting surface. Such damage may result in vibration and/or shimmy, and under severe usage lead to wheel cracking.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remove the valve core from the valve stem.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Deflate the tire completely.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b> <b>Rim-clamp European-type tire changers are recommended.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use the tire changer in order to remove the tire from the wheel.

DO NOT use silicon or corrosive base compounds to lubricate the tire bead and the wheel rim. A silicon base compound can cause the tire to slip on the rim. A corrosive type compound can cause tire or rim deterioration.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Apply GM P/N 12345884 (Canadian P/N 5728223,) or equivalent to the tire bead and the wheel rim.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/119794483.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>10.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Position the rim so the valve stem (1) is situated at the 3 o'clock position relative to the head (2).
