<h1>Inflatable Restraint Sensing and Diagnostic Module Programming and Setup</h1><br><br><b>INFLATABLE RESTRAINT SENSING AND DIAGNOSTIC MODULE PROGRAMMING AND SETUP</b><br><br><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  The air bag indicator light may remain ON after the body control module (BCM), or inflatable restraint sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) is replaced, and during the programming procedure for the BCM until after the procedure is completed. When installing a new SDM, there may be several DTCs set prior to programming. Once programmed, these DTCs should be in history and can be cleared.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  If the SDM was replaced, the SIR warning indicator will remain ON SOLID until after the programming event is complete.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Key on, Engine off. Program the SDM, refer to Service Programming System (SPS).  <a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Testing%20and%20Inspection/Programming%20and%20Relearning/">Programming and Relearning</a><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Key OFF then ON again. If a DTC is set current after programming, follow the diagnostic procedure for that fault.

If during this procedure a fault is detected, the SDM will not allow this procedure to complete. Repair any existing DTC and then use the scan tool to command the special function again.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Key off then on again.
