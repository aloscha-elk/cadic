<h1>Keyless Entry: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>KEYLESS ENTRY SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION</b><br><br><b>KEYLESS ENTRY SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The keyless entry system is a vehicle entry device. The keyless entry system is used in conjunction with the door locks to unlock the vehicle. <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/">Keyless entry</a> will lock/unlock the doors/liftgate, operate the power liftgate (if equipped), or release the liftglass when a corresponding button on the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/Keyless%20Entry%20Transmitter/">keyless entry transmitter</a> is pressed. This is accomplished by the transmitter sending a radio frequency to the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Accessories%2520and%2520Optional%2520Equipment/Radio%252C%2520Stereo%252C%2520and%2520Compact%2520Disc/Remote%2520Control/index.html">remote control</a> door lock receiver (RCDLR). The RCDLR interprets the signal and activates the requested function via a serial data message to the body control module (BCM). A low transmitter or vehicle battery or radio frequency (RF) interference from aftermarket devices, such as 2-way radios, power inverters, computers, etc., may cause a system malfunction. High RF traffic areas may also cause interference that could lead to a malfunction. Keyless entry allows you to operate the following components:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The door and liftgate locks<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The power liftgate (if equipped)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The liftglass<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remote vehicle starting (if equipped)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The illuminated entry lamps<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The keyless entry system has the following components:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/Keyless%20Entry%20Transmitter/">keyless entry transmitters</a><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/">keyless entry</a> antenna (located in the vehicle glass)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The BCM<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The RCDLR<br><br><b>KEYLESS ENTRY TRANSMITTERS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/Keyless%20Entry%20Transmitter/">keyless entry transmitter</a> are used to lock and unlock the vehicle door and rear compartment, operate the power liftgate (if equipped), as well as open the liftglass, from a distance of up to <b>60 feet (18 m)</b> away.

It also activates the vehicles automatic climate control system, if equipped. If moderate or warmer outside temperatures exist, the climate control system will default to automatic temperature control and fan speed to regulate and maintain a moderate inside temperature. When the outside temperature is cold, the climate control system will start up the rear window defogger and default to the front windshield defrost mode with the heat on and the fan blower set to high. If the vehicle has heated seats, they will also turn on. Cooled seats, if equipped, are not activated during a remote start. Normal operation of the climate control system will return after the key is turned to RUN.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>To operate the function, first press and release the lock button on the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/Keyless%20Entry%20Transmitter/">keyless entry transmitter</a>, then immediately press and hold the remote vehicle start (RVS) button for <b>4 seconds</b>.

If the vehicle is left running it will automatically shut off after <b>10 minutes</b> unless a time extension has been done. If the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Accessories%2520and%2520Optional%2520Equipment/Radio%252C%2520Stereo%252C%2520and%2520Compact%2520Disc/Remote%2520Control/index.html">remote control</a> door lock receiver (RCDLR) receives a second request for an RVS event while already operating in RVS, the first timer will expire and the second timer will start. For example, if <b>7 minutes</b> after the initial RVS request, the RVS event is extended, the total time for the RVS event would be <b>17 minutes</b>. To extend an RVS event, first press and release the transmitter lock button, then press and hold the RVS button. When you enter the vehicle during a remote start and the engine is still running, insert the key into the ignition, and turn the key to RUN to drive the vehicle; this will transition the vehicle to normal operation.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>RVS can be deactivated by pressing the RVS button on the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/Keyless%20Entry%20Transmitter/">keyless entry transmitter</a>, pressing the hazard switch, or by turning On the ignition, then turning it OFF. There are also other safety and security measures that will deactivate RVS, these include depressing the accelerator pedal or opening the hood. RVS may not function when DTCs are set. In these instances, the park lights will flash once when the RVS signal is received by the RCDLR, but the vehicle will not start. If the vehicle is put into valet mode, if equipped, by pressing the valet switch, RVS will also be disabled.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>While in RVS mode all modules that are normally powered when the ignition is ON are active.

It is integrated into the hood latch assembly. The hood ajar switch provides 2 separate inputs to the body control module (BCM). These separate inputs allow the BCM to actively monitor for a hood ajar switch fault.<br><br><b>CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION (RVS)</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Accessories%2520and%2520Optional%2520Equipment/Radio%252C%2520Stereo%252C%2520and%2520Compact%2520Disc/Remote%2520Control/index.html">remote control</a> door lock receiver (RCDLR) receives a signal from the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/Keyless%20Entry%20Transmitter/">keyless entry transmitter</a> indicating a remote vehicle start (RVS) request. A message is then sent to the body control module (BCM) which determines if a crank request message will be sent to the engine control module (ECM) to allow engine starting. To determine if conditions are correct for an RVS event, the BCM will ensure the following conditions are met:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle is not in valet mode (if equipped).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>All vehicle doors are closed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The liftgate is not ajar.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A valid hood ajar switch closed signal is present.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The doors are locked.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The hazard switch is OFF.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The vehicle power mode is correct.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>No content theft deterrent (CTD) alarm triggers are present.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the BCM determines all conditions meet those required for an RVS event, a message is sent via serial data to the ECM. The ECM relies on the RVS message from BCM to enable RVS when the crank request signal is received. If the ECM does not receive a valid RVS message, it will not attempt to start the engine. While the ECM is in RVS mode it will suspend engine operation if any of the following additional conditions occur:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vehicle speed is greater than 0.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Transmission is not in PARK.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Excessive engine coolant temperature<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Low oil pressure<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) is commanded ON.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Engine crank time is greater than <b>30 seconds</b>.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Excessive engine speed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Accelerator pedal position too high.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Remote start timer equals 0.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Vehicle theft deterrent (VTD) indicates tamper.<br><br><b><a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/">KEYLESS ENTRY</a> PERSONALIZATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Vehicle lock/unlock functions and remote vehicle start (RVS) settings may be personalized for 2 separate drivers. For mode descriptions and programming instructions, refer to the vehicle owners data.<br><br><b>ROLLING CODE</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The Keyless Entry System uses rolling code technology. Rolling code technology prevents anyone from recording the message sent from the transmitter and using the message in order to gain entry to the vehicle. The term "rolling code" refers to the way that the Keyless Entry System sends and receives the signals. The transmitter sends the signal in a different order each time. The transmitter and the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Accessories%2520and%2520Optional%2520Equipment/Radio%252C%2520Stereo%252C%2520and%2520Compact%2520Disc/Remote%2520Control/index.html">remote control</a> door lock receiver (RCDLR) are synchronized to the appropriate order. If a programmed transmitter sends a signal that is not in the order that the RCDLR expects, then the transmitter is out of synchronization. This occurs after 256 presses of any transmitter button when it is out of range of the vehicle.<br><br><b>AUTOMATIC SYNCHRONIZATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Body%20and%20Frame/Locks/Keyless%20Entry/Keyless%20Entry%20Transmitter/">keyless entry transmitters</a> do not require a manual synchronization procedure. If needed, the transmitters automatically re-synchronize when any button on the transmitter is pressed within range of the vehicle. The transmitter will operate normally after the automatic synchronization.</div>
