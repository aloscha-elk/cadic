<h1>Air Bag: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>DUAL STAGE INFLATOR MODULES</b><br><br>Dual stage inflator modules contain a housing, inflatable <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Restraints%20and%20Safety%20Systems/Air%20Bag%20Systems/Air%20Bag/">air bag</a>, 2 initiating devices, canister of gas generating material and, in some cases, stored compressed gas. The 2 initiators are part of the inflator module deployment loop. The inflator modules have 2 stages of deployment, which varies the amount of restraint to the occupant according to the collision severity. For moderate frontal collisions the inflator modules deploy at less than full deployment which consists of stage 1 of the inflator module. For more severe frontal collisions a full deployment is initiated which consists of stage 1 and stage 2 of the inflator module. When the vehicle is involved in a collision of sufficient force, the sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) will cause current to flow through the deployment loops to the initiator. Current passing through the initiator ignites the material in the canister producing a rapid generation of gas and the release of compressed gas, if present. The gas produced from this reaction rapidly inflates the air bag. Once the air bag is inflated it quickly deflates through the air bag vent holes.<br><br>Each dual stage inflator module is equipped with a shorting bar located on the connectors of the module. The shorting bar shorts the inflator module deployment loop circuitry to prevent unwanted deployment of the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Restraints%20and%20Safety%20Systems/Air%20Bag%20Systems/Air%20Bag/">air bag</a> when it is disconnected.</div>
