On rare occasions, when the vehicle is started at or below 32&deg;F (0&deg;C), the HVAC controls and display may become inoperative.<br><br>This reprogramming should be completed as soon as possible on involved vehicles currently in dealership/retailer inventory and customer vehicles that return to the dealer/retailer for any type of service during the New Vehicle Limited Warranty coverage period.<br><br>Vehicles Involved<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/66012142.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/66014419.png"></div><br><br><br><br>A list of involved vehicles currently in dealer inventory is attached to the Administrative Message (GM US) or Dealer Communication (Canada) used to release this bulletin. Customer vehicles that return for service, for any reason, and are still covered under the vehicle's base warranty, and are within the VIN breakpoints shown. should be checked for vehicle eligibility in the appropriate system listed below.<br><br><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-3'>&#09;</span>Dealers are to confirm vehicle eligibility prior to beginning repairs by using GMVIS. Not all vehicles within the above breakpoints may be involved.<br><br>Service Procedure<br><br>Tech 2(R) Remote Programming Method for HVAC Module<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Note:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Before reprogramming, please check the battery condition to prevent a reprogram error of the driver's seat module due to battery discharge. Battery voltage must be between 12 and 16 volts during reprogramming. If the vehicle battery is not fully charged, use jumper cables from an additional battery. Be sure to turn off or disable any system that may put a load on the battery such as automatic headlamps, daytime running lamps, interior lights, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, radio, engine cooling fan, etc. A programming failure or control module damage may occur if battery voltage guidelines are not observed.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The ignition switch must be in the proper position. The Tech 2(R) prompts you to turn ON the ignition, with the engine OFF. DO NOT change the position of the ignition switch during the programming procedure unless instructed to do so.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Make certain all tool connections are secure, including the following components and circuits:<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The RS-232 communication cable port<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The connection at the data link connector (DLC)<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The voltage supply circuits<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DO NOT disturb the tool harnesses while programming.

Ensure that all control module and DLC connections are secure and the TIS terminal operating software is up to date.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Program the HVAC Module to the latest calibration part number. Be sure to use the Remote Tech 2(R) programming method using both the Tech 2(R) with CANDi module and the TIS terminal.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b><br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Use data version 3.5 or later, broadcast to dealers, and available on TIS2WEB, March 19, 2006 (US), March 22, 2006 (Canada); and on TIS CD-ROM version 4.0/ 2006 which was mailed to dealers beginning April 18, 2006.
