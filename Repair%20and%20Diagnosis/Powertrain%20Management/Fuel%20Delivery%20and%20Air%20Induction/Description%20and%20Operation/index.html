<h1>Fuel Delivery and Air Induction: Description and Operation</h1><br><br><b>FUEL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</b><br><br><b>FUEL SYSTEM OVERVIEW</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The Fuel System is a returnless on-demand design. The fuel pressure regulator is a part of the fuel sender assembly, eliminating the need for a return pipe from the engine. A returnless fuel system reduces the internal temperature of the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a> by not returning hot fuel from the engine to the fuel tank. Reducing the internal temperature of the fuel tank results in lower evaporative emissions.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>An electric turbine style <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Pump/">fuel pump</a> attaches to the fuel sender assembly inside the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a>. The fuel pump supplies high pressure fuel through the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Tune-up%20and%20Engine%20Performance%20Checks/Fuel%20Filter/">fuel filter</a> and the fuel feed pipe to the fuel injection system. The fuel pump provides fuel at a higher rate of flow than is needed by the fuel injection system. The fuel pump also supplies fuel to a venturi pump located on the bottom of the fuel sender assembly. The function of the venturi pump is to fill the fuel sender assembly reservoir. The fuel pressure regulator, a part of the fuel sender assembly, maintains the correct <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Tune-up%2520and%2520Engine%2520Performance%2520Checks/Fuel%2520Pressure/index.html">fuel pressure</a> to the fuel injection system. The fuel pump and sender assembly contains a reverse flow check valve. The check valve and the fuel pressure regulator maintain fuel pressure in the fuel feed pipe and the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Fuel%2520Rail/index.html">fuel rail</a> in order to prevent long cranking times.<br><br><b>E85 FLEX FUEL DESCRIPTION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>E85 compatible vehicles no longer use an alcohol sensor to determine and adjust for the alcohol content of the fuel in the tank. Instead, the vehicle calculates the alcohol content of the fuel through measured adjustments.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The ethanol calculation occurs with the engine running after a refueling event has been detected via a measured change in the fuel level sender output. The virtual flex fuel sensor (V-FFS) algorithm temporarily closes the canister purge valve for a few seconds and monitors information from the closed loop fuel trim system to calculate the ethanol content. This logic executes several times until the ethanol calculation is deemed to be stable. This may take several minutes under low fuel flow conditions such as idle, or a shorter time during higher fuel flow, off-idle conditions.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Air-fuel ratios and the corresponding ethanol percentage are updated following each purge-off sequence. the fuel alcohol content percentage value can be read on a scan tool.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When an E85 compatible vehicle is built, an ECM or PCM replaced, or if the learned alcohol content has been reset with a scan tool the fuel system will need to contain ASTM gasoline with <b>10 percent</b> or less ethanol content.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>A minimum of <b>7.5 Liters (2 gallons)</b> must be put in the tank in order for the vehicle to recognize a re-fueling event. It is not necessary to turn the ignition off in order to have the re-fueling event recognized; however local safety regulations should be followed.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>After the re-fueling event, the system registers the amount of fuel that was added, relative to the amount that was in the tank. Reading fuel trim and O2 sensor activity, the system determines if the fuel added was either ASTM Gasoline or ASTM E85. Based on that determination, the system adjusts to the expected alcohol mix in the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a>, and then the fuel trim and O2 sensor activity fine tunes the adjustments. The system must remain in closed loop in order for this adjustment to occur. Numerous short trips after switching from gasoline to E85, or E85 to gasoline, can result in driveability symptoms due to the inability of the system to adjust for fuel composition by not attaining closed loop operation.<br><br><b>SWITCHING BETWEEN GASOLINE AND E85</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>No special precautions need to be taken when switching back and forth between gasoline and E85 other than re-fueling events must be <b>7.5 Liters (2 gallons)</b> or greater, and the vehicle must remain in closed loop long enough, usually by the time the engine has maintained full operating temperature, to calculate the composition of the new blend in the tank.<br><br><b>FUEL TANKS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tanks</a> store the fuel supply. The front fuel tank is located on the left side of the vehicle. On dual-tank applications, the secondary fuel tank is located in the rear of the vehicle above the spare tire. The fuel tanks are each held in place by 2 metal straps that attach to the frame. The fuel tanks are molded from high density polyethylene.<br><br><b>FUEL FILL PIPE</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The fuel fill pipe has a built-in restrictor in order to prevent refueling with leaded fuel. When refueling dual tank applications, fuel is dispensed to both the front and rear <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tanks</a> at the same time. Once the fill vent is obstructed, fuel backs up the fill pipe and trips the dispensing nozzle. The front fuel tank vent runs into the rear tank to the top of the filler pipe assembly, which in turn vents to atmosphere. The fuel tank vent valves are connected and route to the canister to collect hydrocarbon emissions during operation of the vehicle.<br><br><b><a>FUEL FILLER CAP</a></b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/190838710.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/190843826.png"></div><br><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/190845096.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The fuel fill pipe has a tethered <a>fuel filler cap</a>. A torque-limiting device prevents the cap from being over tightened. To install the cap, turn the cap clockwise until you hear clicks. This indicates that the cap is correctly torqued and fully seated. A built-in device indicates that the fuel filler cap is fully seated. A fuel filler cap that is not fully seated may cause a malfunction in the emission system.<br><br><b>FUEL SENDER ASSEMBLY</b><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/190847171.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The front fuel sender on dual tank applications consists of the following major components:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Fuel%2520Level%2520Sensor/index.html">fuel level sensor</a><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a> fuel pump module<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The fuel strainer<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Tune-up%20and%20Engine%20Performance%20Checks/Fuel%20Filter/">fuel filter</a><br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/190850194.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The rear fuel sender on dual tank applications consists of the following major components:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Fuel%2520Level%2520Sensor/index.html">fuel level sensor</a> (4)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The FTP sensor (1)<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The rear <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Pump/">fuel pump</a> (2)<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/190847171.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The fuel sender assembly on single tank applications consists of the following major components:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Fuel%2520Level%2520Sensor/index.html">fuel level sensor</a><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The fuel tank pressure (FTP) sensor<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a> fuel pump module<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The fuel strainer<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Tune-up%20and%20Engine%20Performance%20Checks/Fuel%20Filter/">fuel filter</a><br><br><b><a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Powertrain%2520Management/Sensors%2520and%2520Switches%2520-%2520Computers%2520and%2520Control%2520Systems/Fuel%2520Level%2520Sensor/index.html">FUEL LEVEL SENSOR</a></b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The fuel level sensor consists of a float, a wire float arm, and a ceramic resistor cord. The position of the float arm indicates the fuel level. The fuel level sensor contains a variable resistor, which changes resistance in correspondence to the amount of fuel in the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Tank/">fuel tank</a>. The engine control module (ECM) sends the fuel level information via the class 2 circuit to the instrument panel (I/P) cluster. This information is used for the I/P fuel gage and the low fuel warning indicator, if applicable. The ECM also monitors the fuel level input for various diagnostics.<br><br><b><a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Powertrain%20Management/Fuel%20Delivery%20and%20Air%20Induction/Fuel%20Pump/">FUEL PUMP</a></b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The fuel pump is mounted in the fuel sender assembly reservoir. The fuel pump is an electric high pressure pump.

There are 3 sizes of nylon pipes used: <b>9.5 mm (3/8 in)</b> ID for the fuel supply, <b>7.6 mm (5/16 in)</b> ID for the fuel return, and <b>12.7 mm (1/2 in)</b> ID for the vent. Heat resistant rubber hose or corrugated plastic conduit protects the sections of the pipes that are exposed to chafing, to high temperatures, or to vibration.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Nylon fuel pipes are somewhat flexible and can be formed around gradual turns under the vehicle. However, if nylon fuel pipes are forced into sharp bends, the pipes kink and restrict the fuel flow. Also, once exposed to fuel, nylon pipes may become stiffer and are more likely to kink if bent too far. Take special care when working on a vehicle with nylon fuel pipes.<br><br><b>QUICK-CONNECT FITTINGS</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Quick-connect fittings provide a simplified means of installing and connecting fuel system components. The fittings consist of a unique female connector and a compatible male pipe end. O-rings, located inside the female connector, provide the fuel seal.

The ECM energizes the injector solenoid to open a normally closed ball valve. This allows the fuel to flow into the top of the injector, past the ball valve, and through a director plate at the injector outlet. The director plate has machined holes that control the fuel flow, generating a spray of finely atomized fuel at the injector tip. Fuel from the injector tip is directed at the intake valve, causing the fuel to become further atomized and vaporized before entering the combustion chamber. This fine atomization improves fuel economy and emissions.<br><br><b>FUEL PRESSURE REGULATOR</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The fuel pressure regulator is contained in the fuel sender assembly.<br><br><b>FUEL METERING MODES OF OPERATION</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The engine control module (ECM) monitors voltages from several sensors in order to determine how much fuel to give the engine.

The system begins Closed Loop operation after reaching these values. In Closed Loop, the ECM calculates the air/fuel ratio, injector ON time, based upon the signal from various sensors, but mainly from the HO2S. This allows the air/fuel ratio to stay very close to 14.7:1.<br><br><b>ACCELERATION MODE</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>When the driver pushes on the <a href="../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Powertrain%2520Management/Fuel%2520Delivery%2520and%2520Air%2520Induction/Accelerator%2520Pedal/index.html">accelerator pedal</a>, air flow into the cylinders increases rapidly. To prevent possible hesitation, the ECM increases the pulse width to the injectors to provide extra fuel during acceleration. This is also known as power enrichment.

The ECM monitors the heated oxygen sensor (HO2S) signal voltage while in Closed Loop and regulates the fuel delivery by adjusting the pulse width of the fuel injectors based on this signal. The ideal fuel trim values are around <b>0 percent</b> for both short term and long term fuel trim. A positive fuel trim value indicates the ECM is adding fuel in order to compensate for a lean condition by increasing the pulse width. A negative fuel trim value indicates that the ECM is reducing the amount of fuel in order to compensate for a rich condition by decreasing the pulse width. A change made to the fuel delivery changes the short term and long term fuel trim values. The short term fuel trim values change rapidly in response to the HO2S signal voltage. These changes fine tune the engine fueling. The long term fuel trim makes coarse adjustments to the fueling in order to re-center and restore control to short term fuel trim. A scan tool can be used to monitor the short term and long term fuel trim values. The long term fuel trim diagnostic is based on an average of several of the long term speed load learn cells. The ECM selects the cells based on the engine speed and engine load. If the ECM detects an excessive lean or rich condition, the ECM will set a fuel trim diagnostic trouble code (DTC).</div>
