<h1>Cooling Fan Always On</h1><br><br><b>Cooling Fan Always On</b><br><br><b>Circuit/System Description</b><br><br>The engine control module (ECM) commands the fans ON in either high speed or low speed, depending on cooling requirements. In low speed, both fans are turned ON at a reduced speed. High speed has both fans turned ON at full speed.<br><br>In low speed operation, the ECM applies ground to the coil side of the fan low relay. This energizes the coil and applies voltage directly to the left cooling fan through the switch side of the fan low relay, which is fed by the fan 1 fuse. The right fan is connected in series to the left fan through the de-energized fan control relay so that both operate at low speed. <br><br>In high speed operation, the ECM applies a ground to the coil side of the fan low relay, the fan control relay, and the fan high relay. On the fan high relay, the energized coil closes the switch side of the relay and applies voltage directly to the right cooling fan through the switch side of the relay, which is fed by the fan 2 fuse. At the same time, the ECM energizes fan control relay pulling the switch side over, providing a direct path to ground for the left cooling fan, which has voltage applied through the energized fan low relay. In high speed mode, the fans are operated as a parallel circuit with full voltage applied to each. <br><br><b>Reference Information</b><br><br><b>Schematic Reference</b><br><br>Engine Cooling Schematics<br><br><b>Connector End View Reference</b><br><br><a href="../../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Engine%2C%20Cooling%20and%20Exhaust/Cooling%20System/">Cooling System</a> Connector End Views<br><br><b>Description and Operation</b><br><br>Cooling Fan Description and Operation<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>Electrical Information Reference</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Circuit Testing<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Connector Repairs<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Testing for Intermittent Conditions and Poor Connections<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Wiring Repairs<br><br><b>Circuit/System Verification</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>If DTCs P0480 or P0481 are set, perform those diagnostics first.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition ON, verify with a scan tool that the control module is not commanding fan activation.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition ON, observe that the fans are not activated.<br><br><b>Circuit/System Testing</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition OFF, disconnect the fan high relay.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Ignition ON, observe that both fans are now OFF.<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>If both fans are OFF, replace the fan high relay.
