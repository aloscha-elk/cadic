<h1>Adjustable Pedals (With Memory)</h1><br><br><b>ADJUSTABLE PEDALS DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION (WITH MEMORY)</b><br><br>The adjustable pedals system is controlled by the adjustable pedal switch and the memory seat module and operation can occur anytime the transmission is not in reverse. The adjustable pedals assembly is moved forward or backward by a motor which is fixed to the brake pedal actuator with a drive cable to the accelerator pedal actuator. The adjustable pedals motor is controlled directly by an h-bridge driver circuit within the memory seat module. In an inactive state both of the outputs to the motor are closed to ground. The memory seat module controls the adjustable pedals motor by applying battery voltage to one of the outputs. The adjustable pedals motor is bidirectional and the direction of the pedal assembly travel is determined by which of the motor control circuits is switched to battery positive voltage while the other remains grounded. The adjustable pedals forward and rearward switches are inputs to the memory seat module. The memory seat module supplies the switch assembly with a battery positive reference voltage. When the switch is operated to the forward or rearward direction, battery positive voltage is applied to the forward or rearward switch signal inputs. The adjustable pedals system is capable of operating in conjunction with the memory seat system. The memory seat module monitors the location of the adjustable pedals using the adjustable pedals position sensor. The adjustable pedals position sensor is supplied with <b>5-volt</b> reference and ground circuits from the memory seat module. The position sensor signal circuit is referenced from ground within the driver seat module. The signal voltage monitored by the driver seat module ranges from <b>0.39-4.58 volts</b> and is determined by the wiper location on the resistor within the position sensor. The position sensor signal circuit voltage level is used by the driver seat module to determine the position of the adjustable pedals when storing or recalling memory position settings. The memory 1 and 2 switches are an inputs to the driver door module and when a memory recall function is activated, the driver door module relays information through the GMLAN Serial Data circuit to the memory seat module in order to operate the adjustable pedals assembly in the appropriate direction until the stored memory position is reached.</div>
