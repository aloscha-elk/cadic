<h1>Wheel Alignment Measurement</h1><br><br><b>Measuring Wheel Alignment</b><br><br>Steering and vibration complaints are not always the result of improper alignment. One possible cause is wheel and tire imbalance. Another possibility is tire lead due to worn or improperly manufactured <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a>. Lead/pull is defined as follows: at a constant highway speed on a typical straight road, lead/pull is the amount of effort required at the steering wheel to maintain the vehicles straight path. Lead is the vehicle deviation from a straight path on a level road without pressure on the steering wheel. Refer to Radial Tire Lead/Pull Correction in order to determine if the vehicle has a tire lead problem.<br><br>Before performing any adjustment affecting wheel alignment, perform the following inspections and adjustments in order to ensure correct alignment readings:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a> for the proper inflation and irregular tire wear. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the runout of the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Steering%2520and%2520Suspension/Wheels%2520and%2520Tires/Wheels/index.html">wheels</a> and the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/index.html#Steering%20and%20Suspension/Wheels%20and%20Tires/Tires/">tires</a>. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the <a href="../../../../../Repair%2520and%2520Diagnosis/Transmission%2520and%2520Drivetrain/Drive%2520Axles%252C%2520Bearings%2520and%2520Joints/Wheel%2520Bearing/index.html">wheel bearings</a> for backlash and excessive play. <br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the ball joints and tie rod ends for looseness or wear.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the control arms and stabilizer shaft for looseness or wear.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>^<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Inspect the steering gear for looseness at the frame.

The fuel tank should be full or the vehicle should have a compensating load added.<br><br>Give consideration to excess loads, such as tool boxes, sample cases, etc. If normally carried in the vehicle, these items should remain in the vehicle during alignment adjustments. Give consideration also to the condition of the equipment being used for the alignment. Follow the equipment manufacturer's instructions.<br><br>Satisfactory vehicle operation may occur over a wide range of alignment settings. However, if the setting exceeds the service allowable specifications, correct the alignment to the service preferred specifications. Refer to Wheel Alignment Specifications.<br><br>Perform the following steps in order to measure the front and rear alignment angles:<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Install the alignment equipment according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Jounce the front and the rear bumpers 3 times prior to checking the wheel alignment.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Measure the alignment angles and record the readings.<br><br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span><b>Important:</b> <b>When performing adjustments to vehicles requiring a 4-wheel alignment, set the rear wheel alignment angles first in order to obtain proper front alignment angles.</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Adjust alignment angles to vehicle specification, if necessary.
