<h1>High Temperature Wiring Repairs</h1><br><br><b>HIGH TEMPERATURE WIRING REPAIRS</b><br><br><b>TOOLS REQUIRED</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>J-38125 Terminal Repair Kit<br><br><b>HIGH TEMPERATURE WIRING</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Wiring that is exposed to high temperatures, <b>135&deg;C (275&deg;F)</b> or higher, for prolonged periods of time may use materials i.e. wires, connectors, and shielding that has a higher heat rating than typical wiring. When making a repair in a high temperature area observe the following:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use high temperature bulk wire rated at <b>150&deg;C (302&deg;F)</b> continuous temperature to replace any damaged wire.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Replace any heat shielding that is removed.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Cover any DuraSeal splice sleeves with SCT1 shrink tubing (available in the J-38125 Terminal Repair kit).<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>After making a wiring repair, ensure that the location of the wiring is not moved closer to the heat source.<br><br><b>IDENTIFYING HIGH TEMPERATURE WIRING</b><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>Wiring that is exposed to high temperature, <b>135&deg;C (275&deg;F)</b> or higher, for prolonged periods of time need special considerations when making wiring repairs. Areas that may be exposed to higher temperatures can be identified by heat resistant materials that are being used in those areas. These materials may include heat reflective tape, moon tape, and high temperature shrink tubing. Also conduit and other protective coverings may be used. Because conduit or similar coverings are used throughout the vehicle regardless of the temperature, it may be necessary for the technician to determine if an area is exposed to excessive heat before making a wiring repair. Obvious areas of consideration would be any area located near the exhaust manifolds, catalytic converter, and exhaust pipes.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The J-38125 contains much of the material you will need to perform repairs on areas exposed to high heat. The kit contains the following items:<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>DuraSeal splice sleeves to crimp and seal connections<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>High temperature SCT1 shrink tubing to protect the splice sleeves<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>A large sampling of common electrical terminals<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The correct crimp tool to attach the terminals to the wires<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>The correct tools to remove the terminals from the connectors<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>The J-38125 does not contain wire that is suitable to high temperature exposure. Use high temperature bulk wire rated at <b>150&deg;C (302&deg;F)</b> continuous temperature of the same or larger gage size as the original wire when repair damage wire. Also replace any reflective tape that you remove during the repair.<br><br><b>HIGH TEMPERATURE WIRE REPAIR</b><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  Refer to Wiring Repairs in order to determine the correct wire size for the circuit you are repairing. You must obtain this information in order to ensure circuit integrity.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/58770850.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>If any wire except the pigtail is damaged, repair the wire by splicing in a new section of wire rated at <b>150&deg;C (302&deg;F)</b> continuous temperature rating of the same gage size (<b>0.5 mm, 0.8 mm, 1.0 mm etc.</b>). Use the DuraSeal splice sleeves and splice crimping tool from the J-38125 and then encapsulate the splice sleeve using the high temperature SCT1 shrink tubing. Use the following wiring repair procedures in order to ensure the integrity of the sealed splice.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>1.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Open the harness by removing any tape.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  You must perform the following procedures in the order listed. Repeat the procedure if any wire strands are damaged. You must obtain a clean strip keeping all of the wire strands intact.<br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>2.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use a sewing seam ripper, available from sewing supply stores, in order to cut open the harness in order to avoid wire insulation damage.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>3.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Cut as little wire off the harness as possible. You may need the extra length of wire in order to change the location of a splice.Adjust splice locations so that each splice is at least <b>40 mm (1.5 in)</b> away from the other splices, harness branches, or connectors.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>4.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Strip the insulation:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>When adding a length of wire to the existing harness, use the same size wire as the original wire.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Perform one of the following items in order to find the correct wire size:<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>Find the wire on the schematic and convert the metric size to the equivalent American wire gage (AWG) size.<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>Use an AWG wire gage.<br><span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-11'>&#09;</span>If you are unsure of the wire size, begin with the largest opening in the wire stripper and work down until achieving a clean strip of the insulation.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Strip approximately <b>7.5 mm (0.313 in)</b> of insulation from each wire to be spliced.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>Do not nick or cut any of the strands. Inspect the stripped wire for nicks or cut strands.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>If the wire is damaged, repeat this procedure after removing the damaged section.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>5.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Slide a section of high temperature SCT1 shrink tubing down the length of wire to be spliced. Ensure that the shrink tubing will not interfere with the splice procedure.<br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>6.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Select the proper DuraSeal splice sleeve according to the wire size. Refer to the above table at the beginning of the repair procedure for the color coding of the DuraSeal splice sleeves and the crimp tool nests.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/58664138.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>7.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Use the Splice Crimp Tool from the J-38125 in order to position the DuraSeal splice sleeve in the proper color nest of the Splice Crimp Tool. The crimp tool has three nests, 1 is for the salmon and green splice sleeve, 2 is for the blue splice sleeve, and 3 is for the yellow splice sleeve.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/58665358.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>8.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Place the DuraSeal splice sleeve in the nest. Ensure that the crimp falls midway between the end of the barrel and the stop. The sleeve has a stop (3) in the middle of the barrel (2) in order to prevent the wire (1) from going further. Close the hand crimper handles slightly in order to firmly hold the DuraSeal splice sleeve in the proper nest.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/58665845.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-2'>&#09;</span>9.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Insert the wire into the DuraSeal splice sleeve barrel until the wire hits the barrel stop.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>10.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Tightly close the handles of the crimp tool until the crimper handles open when released.The crimper handles will not open until you apply the proper amount of pressure to the splice sleeve. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the opposite end of the splice.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/58666107.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>11.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Using the heat torch, apply heat to the crimped area of the barrel.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>12.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Gradually move the heat barrel to the open end of the tubing:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The tubing will shrink completely as the heat is moved along the insulation.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>A small amount of sealant will come out of the end of the tubing when sufficient shrinkage is achieved.<br><br><div class='oxe-image'><img class='big-img' src="../../../../../../../../../images/DM13Q313/gm62/58763303.png"></div><br><br><br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>13.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Center the high temperature SCT1 shrink tube over the DuraSeal splice sleeve.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>14.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Using the heat torch, apply heat to the high temperature heat shrink tubing.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>15.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Gradually move the heat from the center to the open end of the tubing:<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>The tubing will shrink completely as the heat is moved along the insulation.<br><span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>-<span class='indent-8'>&#09;</span>A small amount of sealant will come out of the end of the tubing when sufficient shrinkage is achieved.<br><span class='indent-1'>&#09;</span>16.<span class='indent-5'>&#09;</span>Replace any reflective tape and clips that may have been remove during the repair.</div>
